# skel2smpl — MASTER PLAN (skeleton → SMPL fitting)

`skel2smpl` (`/media/insq/ins/skel2smpl/`) is a **standalone package** that fits an
SMPL body — shape β + uniform scale s + per-frame pose θ (+ §P14 per-bone retarget) —
to an observed reference **skeleton or marker set**, via one principled MAP estimate
per subject. It is imported by `vr/vizsys/smpl_fit.py` (2C / ExPI / ReMoCap viz) and
historically fed the koopman bridge mesh path.

These phases (§P9–P19, §P23) were **EXTRACTED from `koopman/KOOPMAN_MASTER_PLAN.md` on
2026-06-19** — the fitting work had accreted in the koopman plan but belongs with the
package it governs. §P8 (BVH→SMPL rotation retarget for the koopman model's `body_log`
target + retrain) **stays in the koopman plan**: it concerns the koopman MODEL output,
not this fitting module. Cross-refs to §P8 below point back to that plan.

## How to read
- **Active fitting path:** §P13 unified MoSh++/EasyMocap fit (`solve_shape` + `solve_pose`
  with δ latent markers) → §P14 per-bone length retarget → §P16 spine 5→3 reconciliation →
  §P17 anatomical kinematics regularizers. §P15/§P15.1 = the damped-Gauss-Newton pose-solver
  variant. §P23 = the ExPI/2C surface-marker MoSh solve (`fit_markers`).
- **Superseded (historical):** §P9, §P10, §P11, §P12 — earlier shape/pose/retarget attempts
  subsumed by §P13. Kept for provenance.
- The frame convention (SMPL native Y-up → proper Z-up via Q = Rx(+90)·Mᵀ·Rx(+90)) is
  documented in §P13 and the `skel2smpl/fit.py` module docstring.
- Same authoring rules as the koopman plan: read the targeted phase before editing; record
  numerical gates; commit per verified change.

### P11 — Convention-correct BVH→SMPL rotation retarget (the actual mesh fix) [RESOLVED 2026-06-14]
- **Decision (user, 2026-06-13):** the mesh is "fucked up" because we build the SMPL
  skeleton WRONG, then skin it. Both P8 retarget and P10 pose-fit contort the torso
  (bulging belly) — confirmed it's the SMPL POSE θ, not shape, not LBS. P8 derives bone
  DIRECTIONS from joint POSITIONS (spine/pelvis hubs especially); P10 fits θ to positions
  (under-constrains twist). Correct approach: build the SMPL skeleton from the SOURCE
  ROTATIONS with correct conventions, then standard SMPL LBS ⇒ mesh correct BY DEFINITION.
- **Edit (FINAL):** `motion_bridge.bvh_to_smpl_world_rotations` — R_smpl_world_j =
  **M·R_src_world_b·Mᵀ** (PURE CONJUGATION, M = global rest-frame alignment), NO position
  fitting, NO per-joint correction. Pure conjugation induces R_smpl_local = M·R_src_local·Mᵀ,
  i.e. it transports the source's anatomically-correct LOCAL rotations (full twist) straight
  into SMPL ⇒ clean natural mesh. Verified end-to-end by render.
- **Gates (tests/test_bvh_smpl_convention.py):**
  - **G11a rest (PASSING):** `_world_to_theta(identity) = 0` (exact). ✓
  - **G11b motion CONVENTION sanity (PASSING):** primary-bone directions broadly match,
    **mean cosine ~0.96 ≥ 0.93** (shot_031). A gross-convention check, NOT a mesh gate.
- **ROOT CAUSE (diagnosed 2026-06-14):** Comparison/pipeline frame was a REFLECTION.
  `preprocess._read_worldpos` reads positions `(x,y,z)→(x,z,y)` — det **−1**, a mirror —
  while rotations transport via the proper `_RX_NEG90` (det +1). A proper SMPL skeleton can
  NEVER match a mirror-imaged target ⇒ the −0.95 cosine. Fix: compare/feed SMPL against
  observed positions transported by the SAME proper rotation `_RX_NEG90·M` (det +1). The
  Euler order is NOT the bug: source-rotation FK vs raw BVH worldpos = **+0.9996** in the
  BVH frame with order **XYZ** (verified).
- **REJECTED: per-joint rest correction C_j (2026-06-14).** A `C_j = shortest_arc(d_smpl,
  M·d_bvh)` appended on the right drives every bone-direction cosine to 0.9996 — BUT
  full-res renders showed it CREASES the chest and collapses the shoulders ("back folded,
  no clavicle/shoulder", user). shortest_arc fixes the bone DIRECTION while corrupting the
  TWIST (it swings the joint frame away from the correct M-conjugation). The cosine is a
  DIRECTION proxy BLIND to twist; chasing it produced a WORSE human than pure conjugation.
  Also rejected: `swing·M` rest offset (severe torso fold — pushes joint frame ≈M, far from
  canonical), and a global-up full-frame offset (still creases). LESSON: judge mesh quality
  from the RENDER, not the bone-direction number. Pure conjugation's ~4° direction residual
  is visually negligible; the clean local-rotation transport is what makes a correct human.
- **RENDER (Path 1, user-chosen 2026-06-14) — DELIVERED.** `render_convrot.py` renders
  GT actor+reactor SMPL bodies straight from a shot's BVH via `bvh_to_smpl_world_rotations`,
  in the up-preserving PROPER world frame P=Rx(+90)=(x,−z,y), mapping SMPL output in with
  the rigid Q = Rx(+90)·Mᵀ·Rx(+90). No re-bake, no model, no retrain. Result
  (`bridges_p11_convrot.mp4`, shot_031, 300f): both bodies UPRIGHT, clean natural SMPL
  bodies — natural shoulders, smooth torso, no crease/bulge (full-res frames 60/150/240),
  correctly co-located in a believable close-contact exchange. The §P11 mesh fix is proven.
  NOTE on `_RX_NEG90`: it is Rx(−90)=(x,z,−y) and NEGATES up; the up-preserving proper
  rotation is its transpose Rx(+90)=(x,−z,y). The legacy pipeline `_read_worldpos` mirror
  `(x,z,y)` (det −1) preserves up only by being a reflection — that is the incompatibility.
- **PIPELINE INTEGRATION (2026-06-14) — DELIVERED (`viz_bridges --bodies-pose convrot`).**
  - **shot_id (no retrain):** `preprocess_bridges.build_shot` now bakes `shot_id` + `split`
    so the rollout render can locate the GT BVH sources. `actor_body`/`actor_head_global`
    are byte-identical to the prior bake (Δ=0) ⇒ model target unchanged ⇒ NO retrain.
  - **One proper frame for the whole scene.** `_render_vizsys` un-mirrors the scene
    POSITIONS to proper with F=diag(1,−1,1) (proper = F·reflection; a single Y/depth sign
    flip). Bodies are posed directly in proper by TWO clean posers:
    - GT: BVH `bvh_to_smpl_world_rotations` → θ → SMPL.forward(θ,0) → Q=Rx(+90)·Mᵀ·Rx(+90)
      → shift to the proper GT root (the render_convrot method — clean mesh).
    - pred: MoSh++ `fit_smpl_pose` to the F-flipped proper PREDICTED joints (β=0 standard
      body, normal winding, co-located with the proper skeleton).
  - **Why not unify via one rotation path:** `bvh_to_smpl`'s native frame and `body_log`'s
    native frame differ by the global M (≈180° about Y), so feeding BVH θ through the
    retarget path inverts GT; conjugating the predicted ROTATIONS by F (det −1) inverts
    pred through SMPL.forward's _TRANS. Posing each from its own clean source into the
    shared proper POSITION frame (GT=Q-method, pred=moshfit) sidesteps both. Verified by
    render (frames 3/70): GT + pred both upright, clean, co-located; GT shoulders/torso
    natural (§P11 mesh fix preserved through the integration).
  - **Still deferred (Path 2):** full `_read_worldpos`→proper re-bake + retrain to make the
    pipeline natively proper (the convrot scene is currently un-mirrored at render only).

### P12 — Precise SMPL shape + pose (port the EasyMocap-style 3D-point optimizer) [SCOPE A IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-14]
- **Goal (user, 2026-06-14):** the SMPL body must match the **dataset GT skeleton more
  precisely, especially the UPPER BODY** (clavicle/shoulder/spine). Root cause re-confirmed:
  the convrot **pred** path fits θ on a **β=0** body (`motion_bridge.py:233`) against joint
  CENTERS only — wrong limb lengths + unconstrained twist. P9's earlier shape-fit was
  abandoned; **P12 re-opens it the right way** by porting a proven optimizer the user owns.
- **Reference implementation to copy (EasyMocap-style; READ before porting, verify line refs):**
  `/media/insq/ins/pose_estimation/kinematics/optimization.py`
  - `optimizeShape()` **~785–836** — the shape solve: β is a **free var, ONE per sequence**,
    **LBFGS** (`line_search_fn='strong_wolfe'`, `max_iter=50`); objective = **limb-length
    term** (match SMPL bone lengths to observed-keypoint bone lengths, `err = dst-src-
    dir_normalized*limb_length`, conf-weighted) + **L2-β prior** (1e-3) + optional init-anchor
    (1e-2). This is the "estimate shape from 3D points" the user pointed to — bone-length
    matching DECOUPLES shape from pose, more robust than raw joint-position β-fit.
  - 3D-keypoint data term **~361–379** with **robust loss** (GMOF σ²=0.04 / Huber 0.1) +
    per-joint confidence; multi-stage `multi_stage_optimize` **~838–864** (Stage 1 global
    R/t → Stage 2 pose → Stage 3 2D refine); `ftol=1e-4`.
  - Reusable priors/constraints (adopt as needed): **VPoser** VAE prior **~342–359**, **GMM**
    pose prior **~513–598** (`gmm_08.pkl`), 2nd-order **temporal smoothness** with body>limb
    joint weights **~441–511**, **ground/skate** contact (`contact.py`), **collision** capsules
    (`collision.py`), **mesh-jitter** vertex smoothness **~407–424**.
  - SMPL forward/LBS `kinematics/model/smpl_model.py` **~319–405** (axis-angle, shapedirs,
    J_regressor) — reconcile frame with our `vizsys.smpl.SMPL` (Z-up via `_RX_NEG90`).
- **Papers (cite + verify arXiv before gating):** EasyMocap (Shuai et al.) for the multi-view
  multi-stage fitter; SMPLify-X / VPoser (Pavlakos et al. CVPR 2019, arXiv 1904.05866 —
  unverified) for the VAE pose prior; MoSh++/AMASS (Mahmood et al. ICCV 2019, arXiv 1904.03278
  — cited in `motion_bridge.py:229`).
- **Scope decision (ask user before building):** (A) **shape-only** — port `optimizeShape`
  limb-length β solve, feed β into the existing `fit_smpl_pose` for GT subject + pred (smallest,
  highest-leverage); (B) **shape + robust/weighted pose** — also swap pose data term to GMOF +
  upper-body joint weights; (C) **full port** — add VPoser/GMM priors + contact/collision.
  Recommend **A → B**, defer C. We have **no 2D keypoints**, so drop the 2D-reprojection stage.
- **Edits (A, provisional):** `motion_bridge.py` — replace/augment `fit_smpl_shape` (139) with a
  limb-length LBFGS β solve over SMPL-22 bones (downweight the topology-corrupted
  SPINE_NECK_COLLAR per existing handling); thread β through the convrot specs in
  `viz_bridges.py::_render_vizsys` (both GT body + pred `fit_smpl_pose(betas=β)`), reusing the
  `_betas_a/_r` plumbing P9 already added.
- **Numerical gates (`tests/test_smpl_shape_fit.py`):** (G12a) on synthetic data — β-perturbed
  SMPL body resynthesized → limb-length fit **recovers β to ≤0.15 L2** and bone lengths to
  **≤1 cm**; (G12b) on shot_031 — fitted-β SMPL **upper-body** joints (shoulders/elbows/wrists)
  match the dataset skeleton **better than β=0** by ≥30% mean error reduction; (G12c) full
  vizsys suite stays green; (G12d) human visual check — red dataset skeleton overlays the green
  mesh shoulders/clavicle on `--interactive`.
- **Reversible:** β solve behind a flag (`--smpl-betas fit` already exists, currently maps to
  stored β; route it to the new limb-length solve); `--smpl-betas zero` reproduces today's β=0.
- **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-14 (scope A landed):**
  - `motion_bridge.fit_smpl_betas_limblen(joints_obs, pose, smpl_model, …)` — faithful port
    of `optimizeShape:785–836`: one β/sequence, `LBFGS(strong_wolfe, max_iter=50)`, limb-length
    term `err = (J_c−J_p) − unit(J_c−J_p).detach()·‖obs_c−obs_p‖` + L2-β prior. SMPL-22 kintree
    from `SMPL_PARENTS` (`_SMPL22_BONES`); bones ARRIVING at `SPINE_NECK_COLLAR` joints
    downweighted (`spine_weight=0.1`) — collar→shoulder / neck→head kept full-weight (upper body).
  - **AMENDMENT — `w_data` data-term scale:** the §P12 prior weight `lam_reg=1e-3` is EasyMocap's,
    calibrated against a high-weight `s3d` term; our length term is metre² (tiny), so `1e-3`
    over-regularized (measured: ‖β‖ 1.16→0.37, β-L2 0.997). Added `w_data=1000.0`:
    `loss = w_data·data + lam_reg·‖β‖²`. The prior now only bites the **girth null-space** (DOF
    bone lengths cannot constrain, per §P9), not the length-determined β. Measured recovery with
    w_data=1000: β-L2 **0.060**, bone-length **0.010 cm**, ‖β‖ 1.12 (true 1.16).
  - Frame-safe: the limb-length term uses only bone LENGTHS (direction cancels) and lengths are
    frame-invariant, so the convrot `proper_j` is a valid observation despite the proper/_TRANS
    frame gap. Wired in `viz_bridges.py::_render_vizsys` convrot: β solved per CHANNEL from the
    GT bone lengths, applied to the GT body forward AND reused for that channel's pred
    `fit_smpl_pose(betas=β)`. Gated by `--smpl-betas` (zero ⇒ β=0).
  - **Tests** in `tests/test_smpl_shape_fit.py` (shared with P9 G7–G9; the SESSION_CONTINUATION
    handoff wrongly assumed this file was an empty P12 stub — it held the live P9 gates, so P12
    gates were APPENDED, not overwritten): **G12a** synthetic β recovery ≤0.15 L2 + bones ≤1 cm
    (PASS 0.060 / 0.010 cm); **G12b** "different-shape subject" upper-body bone-length error beats
    β=0 by ≥30% — a **hermetic synthetic proxy** for the original shot_031 gate (the real shot_031
    number is the render/visual gate **G12d** via `--interactive`, which needs a checkpoint + GPU
    and is run by the user). Full `tests/` suite green (58).
  - **CRITICAL FINDING — girth inflation on real data (G12d run 2026-06-14, the P9 lesson
    RE-CONFIRMED):** rendered shot_031 (`--bodies-pose convrot --smpl-betas fit`). Limb-length
    matching works *too* well: with the weak prior (`lam_reg=1e-3`) it drove **‖β‖→24** (actor)
    / 15.5 (reactor) — bone LENGTHS matched superbly (upper-body err 3.57→1.67 cm, **+53%**) but
    GIRTH (β's null-space, which NO joint/length data constrains) inflated → visibly blobby mesh.
    Prior-strength sweep (shot_031 actor): there is **NO `lam_reg` giving both ≥30% length match
    AND in-distribution β** — +30% needs ‖β‖≈12 (grossly inflated); sane ‖β‖≈1.5 yields only ~11%.
    This is exactly §P9's conclusion ("joints alone can't recover body width"); the limb-length
    method is more robust at *lengths* but does not escape the girth null-space. The synthetic
    G12a/G12b passed because their obs is SMPL-GENERATED (representable) — they are blind to this.
  - **RESOLUTION (user-chosen 2026-06-14): strong prior, sane β.** Production DEFAULT
    `lam_reg=0.5` ⇒ ‖β‖ **1.55 / 1.23** (β~N(0,I), max|β|≈1.3, no bloat), honest **+11% (actor) /
    +23% (reactor)** upper-body bone-length improvement over β=0. Re-rendered shot_031: mesh
    natural (not blobby), red dataset skeleton overlays the green shoulders/clavicle better than
    β=0. Weak `lam_reg` is for SMPL-representable (synthetic) data ONLY.
  - **AMENDMENT — G12b is a MECHANISM gate, not the real-data target.** The ≥30% reduction is
    only achievable on SMPL-representable data (G12a/G12b pass with explicit `lam_reg=1e-3`). On
    the real Ninjutsu skeleton the achievable-with-sane-β target is ~10–25%, NOT ≥30%. **NEW gate
    G12e** (`test_g12e_real_data_beta_bounded`, shot_031, production prior): asserts ‖β‖ ≤ 2.0
    (no girth bloat) AND upper-body err < β=0 — the guard the synthetic gates cannot provide.
    Full `tests/` suite green (59).
  - **§P9-REDUX LANDED 2026-06-14 (strong-β + uniform SIZE scale s — user-directed "fix it"):**
    added a jointly-fit scalar `s` to `fit_smpl_betas_limblen` (`return_scale=True`): the length
    term becomes `s·(J_c−J_p) − dir·obs_len`, so a uniform `s` captures the subject's SIZE and the
    strong-prior β only carries residual shape. Applied at render as `verts = root + s·(verts−root)`
    (proportional resize about the root — no bloat), for BOTH the GT body and the channel's pred.
    Measured shot_031 (default lam_reg=0.5): actor **+11%→+17%** upper-body, ‖β‖ **1.55→0.87**,
    s=1.131; reactor **+23%→+26%**, ‖β‖ 1.23→1.07, s=1.064. β SHRINKS (safer) AND the match
    improves; s≈1.06–1.13 agrees with §P9's s≈1.155. Re-rendered: mesh natural (not blobby), limbs
    reach the dataset skeleton. **NEW gate G12f** (`test_g12f_real_data_scale_helps`): ‖β‖ ≤ 2.0,
    1.0 ≤ s ≤ 1.4, (β,s) match ≥ β-only. Full `tests/` suite green (60).
  - **SCOPE B CORRECTION 2026-06-14 (spine-only refine in the convrot frame — the RIGHT fix):**
    the first scope-B attempt (`fit_smpl_pose` seeded with the convrot pose + upper-body weights)
    FIXED the lean but introduced a regression the user caught: the SMPL **pelvis rotated ~80°**
    ("a joint mismatch causes the SMPL mesh rotation"). Root cause: the convrot body is posed
    `forward(θ,0)` then mapped to proper by `Q=RXP·Mᵀ·RXP` and grounded; `fit_smpl_pose` evaluates
    joints in its own Q-LESS frame, so seeding it with the convrot θ is a frame mismatch — the
    optimizer swings the ROOT to compensate (measured hip-line err: convrot **0.6°** → bad fit
    **81.8°**). Fix: **`motion_bridge.refine_upper_body_convrot`** — optimizes ONLY the spine chain
    (`free_joints=spine1/2/3,neck,collars,shoulders`) evaluated in the EXACT convrot render frame
    (`forward_R → Q → ground`), freezing root/hips/legs. Measured shot_031: hip-line err STAYS
    0.6°, hips 65mm / knees 58mm unchanged, while pelvis→neck tilt 3.2°→**13.6°** (skel 14.2°),
    head 221→153mm. Pred reverted to a clean β pose fit (no weighting). `--gt-pose fit` (default)
    now calls the refine; `convrot` = legacy. **G12g rewritten**: asserts the refine keeps the
    hip-line within 2° of the rotation transfer (NOT the 80° bad-fit swing) AND moves the tilt
    toward the skeleton. `fit_smpl_pose(joint_weights=…)` / `upper_body_pose_weights` retained but
    no longer used by the render. Full `tests/` suite green (62).
  - **(superseded) first scope-B attempt — upper-body-weighted pose:**
    user observed the SMPL upper body leaning BACK vs the dataset skeleton. Root cause (measured
    shot_031): the convrot pure rotation-transfer (`bvh_to_smpl_world_rotations`) applies correct
    LOCAL rotations to SMPL's rest spine, whose bones point ~34° off the BVH's (`spine3` cosine
    0.83), so the lean is "left behind" — SMPL pelvis→neck tilt **3.6° vs skeleton 14.2°**, head
    **220mm**, shoulders **205mm** off (errors accumulate up the chain). The `C_j` direction fix
    was rejected (§P11, creases chest). Fix: `fit_smpl_pose` gains a `joint_weights` arg
    (`upper_body_pose_weights`: neck/head/collars/shoulders ×6, spine ×2) — the spine joints are
    near-colinear so their positions weakly pin the back/neck rotation, but the head/collar/
    shoulder positions (offset from the axis) DO; upweighting them forces the optimizer to rotate
    the spine to plant them on the skeleton. The convrot GT body now POSE-FITS (init from the
    convrot rotations) instead of rotation-transferring; pred also weighted. Measured: head
    220→**56mm**, shoulders 205→**33mm**, tilt 3.6→**~16°** (skel 14.2°). Re-rendered: upper body
    follows the skeleton's forward lean. **Flag `--gt-pose {fit,convrot}`** (default fit; convrot =
    legacy rotation transfer). **Gate G12g** (`test_g12g_upperbody_weighted_pose_fixes_lean`):
    weighted-fit head/shoulder err < rotation-transfer AND tilt within 3° of skeleton (rotation
    transfer off by >8°). Full `tests/` suite green (62).
  - **GLOBAL FIT 2026-06-14 (now the DEFAULT — supersedes the upper-only refine + foot snap):**
    user: "the whole body fitting should be on optimization" (the deterministic foot-plant snap
    JUMPED on falls). `motion_bridge.fit_smpl_global_convrot` — ONE optimisation of ALL joint
    rotations (incl. root) to the full skeleton, in the EXACT convrot render frame (forward_R →
    Q → ground → §P9 scale), with foot/ankle up-weighting (feet grounded BY the fit, no snap),
    temporal smoothness (no jump), and a prior toward the convrot init (so the root does NOT
    swing — the init is already correct, unlike a Q-less fit). Head-to-head vs the hybrid
    (shot_031): mean joint err **64→42mm**, upper **62→24mm**, lower **53→34mm**, foot-Δ
    **0→1mm** (now WITHOUT a snap), root-Z jerk **2.25→1.14** (≈2× smoother). Wired as
    `--gt-pose fit` (DEFAULT, global); `refine` = upper-only spine refine + deterministic foot
    plant (A/B); `convrot` = legacy rotation transfer. Deterministic foot-plant now applies ONLY
    to refine/convrot/pred. **Gate G12h**: global fit grounds feet ≤30mm (no snap) AND root-Z
    jerk < the snap path. Render verified: skeleton overlays head-to-feet, feet planted.
  - **NOT done (deferred):** scope C (VPoser/GMM pose prior + contact/collision; the smoothness +
    prior here are a lightweight stand-in); pred still uses the Q-less `fit_smpl_pose` + snap
    (GT is the skeleton-match focus). The (β,s)+global-pose fit is the honest ceiling for
    skeletal-only input — larger gains need girth-constraining data (surface/silhouette), per §P9.

### P13 — Principled unified SMPL fit (MoSh++/EasyMocap, ONE optimization) [SUPERSEDES P8/P10/P11/P12 fitting] (2026-06-14)
- **Decision (user, 2026-06-14):** the accreted skeleton+mesh fitting is hacky. Across P8→P12 it
  grew into FOUR fitting functions (`fit_smpl_betas_limblen`, `fit_smpl_pose`,
  `refine_upper_body_convrot`, `fit_smpl_global_convrot`), THREE `--gt-pose` modes
  (fit/refine/convrot), a **deterministic foot-snap**, a **post-hoc render scale** `verts=root+s·(verts−root)`,
  per-joint hand-tuned weight tables (`upper_body_pose_weights`), and DIFFERENT code paths for GT
  vs pred. **Replace all of it with ONE principled MAP optimization** in the MoSh++/EasyMocap mould,
  applied identically to GT and pred. "Find the principle, no special treatment."
- **The principle (MoSh++ / SMPLify, adapted to our data).** Per subject (actor, reactor) solve a
  single MAP estimate of a **shared shape β + uniform size scale `s`**, **per-frame pose θ_t**, and
  **per-frame translation γ_t**, minimizing
      E(β,s,{θ_t},{γ_t}) = λ_D·E_data + λ_β·E_β + λ_θ·E_pose + λ_u·E_smooth + λ_c·E_contact
  with all joints evaluated in ONE world frame (the up-preserving "proper" Z-up frame). Terms:
    - **E_data** — robust 3D-joint distance `Σ_t Σ_j w_j · ρ(‖Φ(θ_t,γ_t,β,s)_j − obs_{t,j}‖)`, with
      Geman-McClure/GMOF robustifier `ρ(r)=σ²r²/(σ²+r²)`, σ²=0.04 (EasyMocap `gmof`,
      `optimization.py:61`). `w_j`: spine/neck/collar **downweighted** (BVH 5-spine→SMPL 3-spine
      topology corruption, the §P9 `SPINE_NECK_COLLAR` set), feet/ankles **upweighted** for contact.
    - **E_β** — `‖β‖²` Mahalanobis shape prior (β~N(0,I); EasyMocap `reg_shapes`).
    - **E_pose** — `Σ_t ‖θ_t − θ_init_t‖²`, the **BVH-retarget anchor**. This is our principled
      substitute for MoSh++'s GMM/VPoser pose prior: unlike marker MoSh we *have* the source BVH
      orientation incl. **twist** (§P11 pure conjugation `M·R_bvh·Mᵀ`), so the data-consistent
      orientation prior is "stay near the retarget", which carries full twist a position-only fit
      cannot. (pred: anchor = the model's predicted `body_log` rotations — symmetric.)
    - **E_smooth** — 2nd-order acceleration `Σ_t ‖θ_{t+1}−2θ_t+θ_{t−1}‖²`, **body>limb weighted**
      (EasyMocap `smooth_poses_loss`, `optimization.py:441-511`; torso ~1e3 : limb ~1).
    - **E_contact** — replaces the deterministic snap. Detect foot contact by height+velocity
      threshold + median filter (EasyMocap `contact.py`: h_thresh≈0.08 m, v_thresh≈0.25 m/s, med
      size 5); penalize ground penetration `relu(−z)²` and in-contact xy skate `‖Δxy‖²·contact`
      INSIDE the objective (`optimization.py:387-397`). Feet plant naturally, no jump on falls.
- **The de-hack = frame + one forward.** `vizsys.smpl.SMPL.forward_R` runs FK then applies
  `_TRANS=Rx(−90)` (`smpl.py:78-81`), so its output reaches the proper render frame only via the
  rigid `Q = Rx(+90)·Mᵀ·Rx(+90)` (M = `_rest_frame_alignment` Procrustes, `motion_bridge.py:808`).
  Q is CORRECT and kept — but applied **once**, inside a SINGLE `forward_proper(θ,γ,β,s,Q)` =
  forward_R → Q-conjugate → scale `s` about root → place at γ. This one function is used by BOTH the
  objective and the render, for BOTH GT and pred. The observed joints (worldpos for GT, decoded
  `body_log` for pred) are un-mirrored to proper **once** at ingress with `F=diag(1,−1,1)`. No more
  per-function Q, in-objective root-shift, post-hoc render scale, or snap. **Scale `s` is a fit
  variable** (solved in the shape stage, applied via `forward_proper`) — folds today's render hack
  into the optimization (user decision 2026-06-14).
- **Staging (EasyMocap `multi_stage_optimize`, `optimization.py:838-864`).**
  1. **Shape stage** — `(β,s)` via the limb-length solve (EasyMocap `optimizeShape:785-836`, LBFGS
     strong-Wolfe, `err=s·(J_c−J_p)−unit(J_c−J_p)·‖obs_c−obs_p‖`, `λ_β` strong so girth→mean). This
     math is the already-faithful `fit_smpl_betas_limblen` port — KEEP it as the shape stage.
  2. **Pose stage** — `(θ_t,γ_t)` MAP fit (E_data+E_pose+E_smooth+E_contact), β,s fixed. LBFGS/Adam.
     This single stage REPLACES `fit_smpl_global_convrot`+`refine_upper_body_convrot`+`fit_smpl_pose`.
- **Scope decisions locked (user, 2026-06-14):** size = optimized scale folded into the fit (NOT
  post-hoc, NOT β-only); frame = **fit+viz rewrite only, NO re-bake / NO retrain** (`body_log` target
  untouched; single un-mirror at render/fit ingress — the §P11 "Path 2" full proper re-bake stays
  deferred); contact = **principled contact term** (not the snap, not data-weight-only).

- **Edits:** NEW `smpl_fit.py` (the unified module: `solve_shape`, `solve_pose`, `forward_proper`,
  `detect_contacts`, `gmof`, weight tables). `viz_bridges.py::_render_vizsys` — collapse the 4-body
  loop to ONE path (obs→proper, solve_shape[GT]/reuse[pred], solve_pose, forward_proper); retire
  `--gt-pose` modes + snap + post-hoc scale. `render_convrot.py` — route through `forward_proper`.
  Legacy `motion_bridge.py` fitters kept importable behind `--fit legacy` for A/B only.
- **Numerical gates (`tests/test_smpl_fit_unified.py`):**
  - **G13a (frame identity):** `forward_proper` with θ=BVH-retarget, s=1, β=0 reproduces the
    `render_convrot.py` GT verts within **1e-4 m** (the unified forward ≡ the proven §P11 render).
  - **G13b (shape recovery, synthetic):** β,s-perturbed SMPL resynth → shape stage recovers β ≤**0.15**
    L2 and bone lengths ≤**1 cm** (carry-over of G12a; the limb-length math is unchanged).
  - **G13c (pose fit ≥ old global):** on shot_031 the unified pose stage matches the dataset skeleton
    **≤ the P12 global fit** — mean joint err **≤ 42 mm**, upper-body **≤ 24 mm** (no regression).
  - **G13d (contact, no snap):** feet grounded **≤ 30 mm** AND root-Z jerk **< the P12 snap path**,
    with NO deterministic snap in the code path (term-only).
  - **G13e (unification):** GT and pred go through the SAME `solve_pose`+`forward_proper`; assert one
    code path (no `--gt-pose` branch, no `if not grounded` snap) — guards against re-accretion.
  - **G13f (full suite):** all `tests/` green; legacy fitters still import.
  - **G13g (visual, user):** red dataset skeleton overlays green mesh shoulders/clavicle/feet on
    `--interactive` for BOTH GT and pred, both subjects, at full render resolution (per memory:
    verify-renders-at-full-resolution).
- **Reversible:** `--fit {unified,legacy}` (unified default; legacy = the P12 path). `--fit legacy`
  reproduces today's render exactly.
- **Risk:** (a) frame bug in the single `forward_proper` → caught by G13a vs the proven render;
  (b) contact term over-constrains during real foot lift → tune thresholds, fall back to data-weight;
  (c) LBFGS instability on the long pose stage → Adam warm-start then LBFGS, as EasyMocap does.
- **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-14 (`smpl_fit.py`; `--fit unified` is the DEFAULT).**
  - `smpl_fit.compute_Q`, `forward_proper` (the ONE shared forward — verts for render, fast
    joints-only `_fk` for the hot loop), `solve_shape` (wraps the limb-length `fit_smpl_betas_limblen`),
    `solve_pose`, `detect_contacts`, `gmof`. Wired into `viz_bridges._render_vizsys` convrot block as
    a single GT+pred loop behind `--fit {unified,legacy}` (legacy = the P12 path, honors `--gt-pose`).
  - **AMENDMENT — latent joint offsets (the user's "consider the skeleton mismatch too", 2026-06-14).**
    The observed skeleton's joints are NOT SMPL's J_regressor joints (BVH 5-spine collapsed into
    SMPL's 3-spine), so forcing ‖SMPL_j−obs_j‖→0 DISTORTS the pose to chase a convention gap — this
    was the upper-body residual, not optimiser slack. Following MoSh++'s LATENT MARKERS, `solve_pose`
    now also solves a per-joint body-attached offset `δ_j` (shared across frames): the virtual marker
    `marker_j = SMPL_j + s·R_world_j·δ_j` matches obs while the BODY stays natural. δ is regularised
    PER JOINT — WEAK on the topology-corrupted `SPINE_NECK_COLLAR` set (δ absorbs the ~40–60 mm spine
    gap), STRONG elsewhere (δ≈0 so limbs/feet match by pose and do not drift/float). The render uses
    the BODY (`forward_proper`, no δ); δ is the data correspondence, not the mesh.
  - **AMENDMENT — δ-free set = the whole UPPER-BODY region (user: "shoulders and head still weird",
    2026-06-14).** Allowing δ only on the spine but forcing head(15)+shoulders(16,17) to obs by pose
    HUNCHED the shoulders and STRETCHED the neck (the compressed SMPL spine can't reach the higher
    BVH neck/head/shoulder targets, so the optimiser raised them). Fix: `_DELTA_FREE =
    (3,6,9,12,13,14,15,16,17)` — spine + neck + collars + head + shoulders all carry δ (Mixamo vs
    SMPL clavicle/neck/head anatomy differs), so the BODY upper body sits naturally while the markers
    reach obs. STRONG δ stays on root/hips/knees/ankles/feet/elbows/wrists (match by pose). Re-render
    confirmed: shoulders slope naturally (no hunch), neck/head natural, arms still reach. G13c now
    measures the strong-δ ELBOWS/WRISTS (≤40 mm) since shoulders are intentionally offset-absorbed.
  - **AMENDMENT — geodesic smoothness kills the mesh-TWIST flip (user: "twist in mesh… fast
    rotation/flipping in joint rotation", 2026-06-14).** In extreme poses (the reactor's ground
    roll) a distal joint (elbow/wrist) FLIPPED ~180° between frames — position fit fine, but the
    forearm TWIST about the bone axis is unconstrained by position, so the optimiser flipped branches
    → visible mesh twist. The axis-angle 2nd-order smoothness `‖Δ²θ‖²` did NOT stop it (not
    double-cover-safe, and raising the anchor killed arm reach before the flip). Fix: smoothness is
    now GEODESIC — chordal `‖R_t−R_{t+1}‖²_F` on the joint rotation matrices (double-cover-safe,
    smooth gradient, MAX exactly at a 180° flip). Measured reactor: max frame-to-frame rotation
    **177°→17°** with elbow/wrist fit still 16 mm (no reach cost). Defaults `lam_smooth=0.05`
    (chordal), `lam_anchor=0.01` (picks the correct twist branch from the BVH). **NEW gate G13h**:
    solved reactor pose has NO frame-to-frame joint rotation > 90°. Re-render confirmed: the roll is
    a natural curled body (no twist), the standing body has natural sloping shoulders (no hunch).
  - **AMENDMENT — clavicle REST-anchor kills the residual hunch (user: "shoulders still a bit
    unnatural… the original clavicle skeleton is forward vs SMPL", 2026-06-14).** Root cause (user-
    diagnosed, confirmed): the Mixamo clavicle sits FORWARD of SMPL's, so the BVH local rotation
    transferred onto SMPL's clavicle rotates it forward (measured collar **24°→35°** from rest;
    a real clavicle barely moves) → hunch. The latent δ absorbs the clavicle's forward POSITION for
    the marker, but the pose ANCHOR (‖θ−init‖² toward the BVH transfer) re-injected the forward
    rotation into the BODY. Fix: the anchor is now PER-JOINT — the collars (13,14) anchor to REST
    (θ=0, the anatomically-natural near-static clavicle), everything else to the BVH init. This
    decouples the convention gap (→δ, position) from the body orientation (→rest). Measured: collar
    **35°→2°**, the shoulder/glenohumeral joint takes up the arm raise (72°→86°, anatomically
    correct), arm reach cost only ~5 mm (elbow/wrist 19→27 mm). Defaults `lam_rest=0.2`,
    `rest_joints=(13,14)`. Re-render confirmed: shoulders slope naturally, no hunch. G13c threshold
    relaxed to ≤50 mm (the deliberate naturalness-vs-reach trade) keeping the ≥30%-better-than-init guard.
  - **AMENDMENT — dual-quaternion skinning kills the LBS joint collapse (user: "mesh skinning
    still has… collapsed mesh in joint rotations of hands/elbow/shoulder, maybe dual quaternion
    blending", 2026-06-14).** SMPL render used Linear Blend Skinning, which linearly averages bone
    transforms per vertex → the "candy-wrapper" volume collapse at large rotations/twist (elbows,
    wrists, shoulders). Added Dual-Quaternion Skinning (Kavan, Collins, Žára, O'Sullivan 2008,
    "Geometric Skinning with Approximate Dual Quaternion Blending", ACM TOG 27(4); DOI unverified):
    `vizsys.smpl` gains `_mat_to_quat`/`_quat_mul`/`_quat_conj` + `SMPL._dqs` and a
    `forward_R(skinning='lbs'|'dqs')` flag (DEFAULT 'lbs' — the shared boxing path is unchanged).
    Blends per-bone rigid transforms as unit dual quaternions with per-vertex antipodality (pivot =
    max-weight bone), preserving rigidity/volume. `smpl_fit.forward_proper(skinning=…)` threads it;
    the unified viz render requests `'dqs'`. Verified: DQS == LBS at rest and under a global rigid
    transform to **1e-16** (exact), finite under extreme poses; render shows rounder elbows/forearms
    (no collapse). **NEW gate G13i** (DQS≡LBS rest+rigid ≤1e-6, finite under bent/twisted arm).
  - **Measured shot_031 actor (frames 64:224, the running demo):** freeing the spine via δ lets the
    arm chain reach — rendered BODY joints **shoulders 34 mm, elbows 19 mm, wrists 15 mm, feet 7 mm**
    (vs the P12 global fit's ~46 mm upper average); the marker fit reaches obs at the spine (body
    spine ~84 mm is the honest 5→3 gap, carried by δ). Falls are grounded smoothly by the contact
    term (no snap-jump). Speed: the joints-only `_fk` runs the 900-iter pose solve in ~6 s/body (was
    ~min with the verts-in-loop forward).
  - **Tests** `tests/test_smpl_fit_unified.py` G13a–f ALL PASS (6, in ~7 s): G13a frame identity
    ≤1e-4 m vs `render_convrot`; G13b (β,s) bone recovery ≤1 cm; G13c body arm joints ≤40 mm AND
    ≥30% better than init; G13d feet ≤30 mm grounded with NO snap in `solve_pose`; G13e one path for
    GT+pred; G13f legacy fitters still import. G13g (visual) DELIVERED — `bridges_p13_unified.mp4`
    (shot_031, 200f): natural shoulders/clavicle (no §P11 crease), red skeleton overlays the mesh,
    smooth grounded falls. `--fit legacy` reproduces the P12 render. Full `tests/` suite re-run PENDING.
  - **AMENDMENT — E_smooth was 1st-order VELOCITY, not 2nd-order acceleration (user: "the smpl
    motion is still not natural", 2026-06-14).** The geodesic amendment (above) correctly swapped
    axis-angle→chordal to kill the twist-flip, but it SILENTLY also dropped the difference order from
    2nd (acceleration `‖θ_{t+1}−2θ_t+θ_{t-1}‖²`, the §P13 spec + the `solve_pose` docstring) to 1st
    (velocity `‖R_t−R_{t+1}‖²_F`). A velocity penalty's loss-minimiser is a STATIC pose, so it damped
    ALL real motion: measured on shot_031 the solved upper body kept only **arms 57%, torso 76%,
    shoulders 76%** of the BVH-source angular speed (collars 15%, see next). Fix: true 2nd-order
    chordal acceleration `Rloc[2:]−2·Rloc[1:-1]+Rloc[:-2]` at the SAME `lam_smooth=0.05` (still
    chordal/double-cover-safe → G13h flip-guard holds). Restores **arms 82%, torso 102%, shoulders
    95%** at ZERO data-fit cost (58.55 vs 58.59 mm). Verified by a 15-agent diagnose workflow
    (audit + numerical probes + adversarial verify). **NEW gate G13j** (solved upper-body angular
    speed ≥ 0.75× source). The collar near-freeze (15%) is the SEPARATE `lam_rest=0.2` rest-anchor —
    deferred knob (reduce toward ~0.05 if clavicles read stiff; risks re-admitting the hunch).
  - **AMENDMENT — foot FLATTENING / heel-bury fix (user: "the toe mesh is upper than the skeleton
    toe → walking on their ankles with the toe in the air", 2026-06-14).** The dataset is a
    ball-of-foot (heel-raised) stance — obs ankle ≈94 mm, toe ≈34 mm (the contact), pitch ≈−23°. The
    BVH **init already has this correct pitch (−21°)**, but at the fitted scale `s≈1.13` the over-long
    SMPL shin would over-shoot the feet downward, so the optimiser DROPPED the ankle ~40 mm to keep
    the toe grounded → FLATTENED the foot to −8°, and the heel **mesh** sank ~20 mm below the floor
    (the contact term grounds the toe JOINT only). Visually: heel buried, toe lifted. Fix: (a) anchor
    the ANKLE rotation (7,8) to its correct init with `lam_ankle=0.5` (analogous to the clavicle
    rest-anchor — preserves the init pitch instead of letting the data term flatten it); (b) raise the
    foot data weight `foot_weight` 5→**12** (grounds the toe firmly without destabilising; higher
    plateaus/worsens). Measured shot_031: ankle gap 41→**29 mm** (actor) / 50→**3–9 mm** (reactor),
    pitch −8°→**−15° actor / −28° reactor** (≈ data), mesh sole penetration −20→**−10 mm**, toe still
    grounded, non-foot fit unchanged, all prior gates green. **NEW gate G13k** (solved ankle vertical
    gap < 35 mm — no flatten/bury). **Residual (~29 mm low) — RE-DIAGNOSED & FIXED in §P14 (2026-06-14):**
    this was NOT a per-segment shape gap. It was THIS amendment's sibling knob `lam_contact=20`
    OVER-grounding: the strong ground term flattens the foot (pitch collapses, ankle drops ~30 mm) to
    bury the toe. See the contact-retune amendment below.
  - **AMENDMENT — contact-weight retune `lam_contact` 20→8 (§P14 diagnosis, 2026-06-14).** The deferred
    ~29 mm actor ankle residual above was mis-blamed on leg PROPORTION. A shot_031 sweep (retarget ON)
    proved the cause is the contact weight: at `lam_contact=20` the ground-penetration + anti-skate term
    over-grounds the toe and FLATTENS the foot (dataset pitch 22.8° → solved flat), dropping the ankle.
    At **`lam_contact=8`** the foot pitches naturally (23.5°), the actor ankle gap **30→1 mm** (reactor
    4→1.5 mm), in-contact skate IMPROVES (2.70→1.15 mm/frame), for +2 mm max penetration (5→7 mm — within
    the mesh-sole tolerance). Lowered the `solve_pose` default 20→**8** (benefits the boxing path too —
    the over-flattening is scale-independent). Orthogonal to the §P14 leg retarget (that fixes bone
    LENGTHS, this fixes foot PITCH). All 10 P13 gates + all 6 P14 gates green (16 passed).
  - **AMENDMENT — collar de-stiffen (user: "fix everything", 2026-06-14).** The clavicle rest-anchor
    `lam_rest=0.2` (added to kill the hunch) over-froze the collars to **15%** of source speed. Sweep:
    at `lam_rest=0` the optimiser drives the collar to **39°** forward (full hunch) chasing arm reach;
    at **`lam_rest=0.1`** the collar sits at **6.3°** = the natural BVH init (6.8°, NO hunch) with ~2×
    the motion (speed 0.12→0.19) and better arm reach (44→42 mm). Lowered the default 0.2→**0.1** (safe
    no-hunch point; 0.05 gives more motion at a mild 11° lean if wanted). All 10 gates green.
  - **AMENDMENT — lower-body de-wobble: smooth the LEGS like the torso + `lam_smooth` 0.05→0.20 (user:
    "the whole lower body mesh is wobble", 2026-06-14).** ROOT CAUSE: the smoothness weight `sw` smoothed
    the torso 3× but the **legs/feet only 1×** — under-smoothed, so the lower body jittered (2nd-order
    accel ~4.5× the BVH source). STRUCTURAL FIX: `sw[_LEGS]=sw[_FEET]=3` (the lower body is a slow stance
    → smooth it like the torso; only the fast distal ARMS stay sw=1 so strikes keep speed) + `lam_smooth`
    0.05→**0.20**. Together: lower-body accel 4.5×→**~0.5× source** (smoother than source) while arm speed
    ratio stays **0.95** (≥0.75, G13j). **TESTED & REJECTED — uniform data weights** (user's "same weights
    for everything"): `foot_weight` 12→1 DOES give a natural knee (9°) and smooth legs, but FLOATS the
    feet ~5 cm / FLATTENS them (pitch 23→12°) — without the foot data weight the natural straight leg
    can't reach the grounded dataset foot. So `foot_weight=12` stays (grounding); the wobble is cured by
    smoothing, not by reweighting. **NEW gate G13l** (knee accel ≤2.5× source AND knee bend-angle err
    ≤30°). All 17 gates green (G13a–l + G14a–f).
  - **AMENDMENT — bigger body `lam_reg` 0.5→0.1 (user: "smpl should be bigger, β over-regularized",
    2026-06-14) — a DELIBERATE relaxation of the §P9/§P12 girth guard.** The dataset is skeleton-only,
    so girth is unconstrained; §P12 pinned β to the mean (`lam_reg=0.5` ⇒ ‖β‖≈0.86, a slim mesh) to
    avoid the §P9 girth bloat (`lam_reg=1e-3` ⇒ ‖β‖→24, blobby). The user wants the fuller fighter
    build. Sweep (shot_031 actor): `lam_reg` 0.5→0.2→**0.1**→0.05 gives ‖β‖ 0.86→2.0→**3.5**→5.4, s
    1.13→1.17→**1.23**→1.30, body depth +1.8/**+4**/+6 cm, AND a better length fit (worst non-spine bone
    67→**55**→48 mm). Chose **0.1** as the `solve_shape` default — clearly bigger, β within ~3σ (no
    blobby bloat); ≤0.05 (‖β‖>5) risks it; 0.2 is the conservative fallback. This is the one place the
    §P9 "girth→mean" invariant is intentionally loosened; it does NOT affect the synthetic gates (G13b/
    G14 call solve_shape with explicit weak/own lam_reg). Tune in `solve_shape`. All 17 gates green.
  - **AMENDMENT — knee anchor `lam_knee` 0.01→0.15 (user: "the ankle/toe fitting ruined the knee, fix
    that", 2026-06-14).** Diagnosis (knee measured by BEND ANGLE + position, not the earlier accel): the
    dataset legs are near-straight (knee ≈167.5°; BVH init ≈161°, good), but the strong foot data terms
    (`foot_weight=12` on ankle+toe) OVER-FLEX the solved knee to **134° (33.7° off)** and shove it ~122mm
    off its obs position to nail the feet — the "foot fitting ruins the knee" artifact. Fix = anchor the
    knee ROTATION to its good init bend (same pattern as `lam_ankle` for foot pitch, `lam_rest` for the
    collar). **This is a genuine knee↔foot TRADEOFF** — knee bend and ankle grounding are coupled through
    SMPL's fixed (retargeted) bone lengths, so the two cannot both be perfect: `lam_knee` sweep (actor)
    0.01→0.1→0.15→0.2→0.3 gives knee err 33.7→28.4→**24.9**→21.5→15.9° while the ankle lifts
    1→13→**21**→29→40mm. Chose **0.15** (knee 33.7→24.9°, pos 122→94mm; ankle ~1→23mm, still grounded <
    the G13k 35mm). **G13l gate EXTENDED** to also guard knee bend-angle err ≤30° (bites at the
    un-anchored ~34°). **G14c RELAXED** ≤15→≤25mm ankle to reflect the chosen tradeoff (the contact
    retune alone still grounds to ~1mm; the knee anchor trades ~22mm of that back for a natural knee).
    Knob exposed in `solve_pose` — raise for a straighter knee at the cost of more foot lift. All 17 green.
  - **DONE in §P14 — lower-leg per-segment bone-length retarget.** Measured bones (shot_031 actor,
    scaled): SMPL **thigh −30 mm (too short), shin +14 mm (too long)** vs the dataset — a leg PROPORTION
    error a uniform scale can't redistribute and β can't fix without re-inflating girth (§P9 guard).
    §P14 retargets each leg bone to the dataset length (translation form, girth-preserving): bones now
    ≤5 mm (G14a). NOTE: this turn ALSO corrected the belief that the ankle-height residual came from
    this proportion error — it did not (it was `lam_contact=20`; see the contact-retune amendment).
  - **NOT done (deferred):** scope C (VPoser/GMM pose prior — the BVH anchor + δ stand in); the §P11
    "Path 2" full proper re-bake/retrain (un-mirror still at ingress only, per user decision).

### P14 — Per-segment bone-length retarget (anthropometric SMPL) [extends §P13 shape stage] (2026-06-14)
- **Why (user: "build the leg-proportion retarget", 2026-06-14).** After the §P13 `solve_shape` (β +
  uniform `s`) the SMPL leg PROPORTIONS still mismatch the dataset skeleton — measured shot_031 actor
  (scaled bones): **thigh −30 mm (too short), shin +14 mm (too long)**, foot −5 mm. β's PCA shape space
  + ONE uniform scale cannot set arbitrary PER-BONE lengths (the web-search surfaced bone-length-explicit
  models like MHR precisely because β under-determines per-bone length). This proportion error is why the
  §P13 foot-pitch fix leaves the actor **ankle ~29 mm low** (the over-long shin drops the ankle). Fix:
  retarget each SMPL rest BONE to the dataset's measured length, deforming the mesh consistently.
- **Approach (standard skinned-mesh bone retarget, applied in the BIND/rest pose BEFORE LBS).**
  1. **Target bone lengths** from the dataset (frame-invariant, like the existing limb-length fit): for
     each kinematic edge parent `p`→child `c`, `L_data[c] = mean_t ‖obs[c]−obs[p]‖`.
  2. **Per-bone ratio** `r[c] = L_data[c] / L_smpl[c]`, `L_smpl[c] = ‖J[c]−J[p]‖` on the β-shaped rest
     joints `J = J_regressor @ v_shaped` (vizsys/smpl.py:101). Root `r[0]=1`.
  3. **Retarget rest JOINTS hierarchically** (root→leaf over `SMPL_PARENTS`):
     `J'[c] = J'[p] + r[c]·(J[c]−J[p])` — child joints carry the cumulative parent retarget + local scale.
  4. **Retarget rest VERTICES mesh-consistently via the SKINNING WEIGHTS** `self.weights` [6890,24]
     (vizsys/smpl.py:80): blend each vertex's bind-pose displacement by its bone weights so there are NO
     seams. **BUILD CHOSE THE TRANSLATION FORM** (see BUILD DECISION below):
     `v'[i] = v[i] + Σ_b W[i,b]·( J'[b] − J[b] )` — ride each vertex along by the LBS-weighted joint
     displacement. (The originally-specced isotropic form `v'[i]=Σ_b W[i,b]·(J'[b]+r[b]·(v[i]−J[b]))`
     was rejected on build evidence: it inflates girth by r and distorts interior leg edges to a 0.64–1.49
     ratio; the translation form preserves girth and holds edges to 0.89–1.18 — numbers below.) Reuses the
     SAME `W` LBS already uses → consistent skin. Both forms hit the exact target bone lengths (joints=J').
  5. Feed `J'`, `v'` into the existing LBS/DQS forward (`forward_R`→`_global_transforms`, vizsys/smpl.py:
     92,105). Pose θ, the δ markers, and the contact term are UNCHANGED — they now act on the retargeted
     rest skeleton+mesh. Pred reuses the GT subject's `r` (like β/s).
- **Scope/constraints.** LEGS first (the long bones 4,5,7,8,10,11 — thigh/shin/foot L+R); see BUILD
  DECISION for why the hip-offset bones 1,2 were EXCLUDED. **OPT-IN** flag on the SHARED `vizsys/smpl.py`
  (default OFF → the boxing path + all P13 gates bit-identical). **Girth:** the chosen translation form
  preserves girth by construction (leg-tri area ratio 1.001–1.008, i.e. a pure length change, not the
  r²≈14% cross-section blow-up the isotropic form would give) — fully consistent with the §P9 invariant
  (β/shape untouched).

- **BUILD DECISION (2026-06-14, grounded on a shot_031 probe before implementation):**
  - **Vertex form = TRANSLATION** `v'=v+W·(J'−J)`, NOT the originally-recommended isotropic scale. Evidence
    (shot_031 actor, the §P13 (β,s) fit, long-bone set): isotropic gives leg edge-ratios [0.64,1.49] and
    inflates girth; translation gives [0.89,1.18] and leg-tri area ratio 1.008 (girth preserved). Both
    reach the exact target bone lengths (the gate G14a measures joints, set by step 3 = J', identical for
    either vertex form). Translation is also the standard skinned-mesh bone-length retarget.
  - **Bone set = long bones {4,5,7,8,10,11} only** (hips 1,2 EXCLUDED). The probe found hips 1,2 at r≈0.86
    (a ~15 mm pelvis-WIDTH mismatch, stance not leg-length) which drove the worst mesh shear (edge max
    1.49→1.21 when dropped) and is not the ankle-drop motivation. Resolves the spec's "legs-only vs
    all-bones" open question with data. r for non-leg bones (incl. hips, root, hands) stays 1 → identity.
  - **r is s-ORTHOGONAL:** `r[c] = L_data[c] / (s · L_smpl_β[c])` (divide out the uniform §P13 scale s so
    the forward's `scale=s` then yields s·r·L_smpl_β = L_data exactly). Refines spec step 2 (which omitted
    s). Keeps β, s, and bone_scale orthogonal and individually testable (the recommended open-q answer).
  - **Measured residuals (shot_031 actor, s=1.131):** thigh −30.3/−22.3 mm (r 1.072/1.052), shin
    +13.8/+14.0 mm (r 0.969/0.968), foot −5.5/−5.1 mm (r 1.037/1.035). After retarget: ±0.00 mm.

  - SMPL (Loper et al., ACM TOG 2015) — LBS, skinning weights `W=self.weights`, `J_regressor`, β PCA
    encodes bone-length VARIATION but not arbitrary per-bone length. The retarget reuses `W` and `J`.
  - Bone-length-explicit body models (MHR and similar; web-search 2026-06-14) — motivation that β alone
    under-determines per-bone length / skeletal proportion. VERIFY exact citation in the build.
  - Standard bind-pose per-bone scaling propagated by skinning weights (character-retarget graphics) —
    cite a concrete source in the build.
- **Numerical gates (`tests/test_smpl_fit_unified.py` or a new `test_bone_retarget.py`).**
  - **G14a (bones match):** after retarget, SMPL leg bones (thigh/shin/foot, L+R) within **≤5 mm** of the
    dataset bone lengths (was thigh −30, shin +14).
  - **G14b (mesh integrity):** vertex count unchanged 6890, no NaN; per-edge length-change ratio across
    leg-region triangle edges within the per-bone scale ± a small seam tolerance (no torn seam).
  - **G14c (foot grounded):** actor ankle vertical gap **≤25 mm** (was ~29, gate renamed/relaxed). The
    §P13 contact retune `lam_contact` 20→8 grounds it to ~1 mm; the §P13 knee anchor `lam_knee=0.15`
    (de-ruins the over-bent knee) then lifts it back to ~23 mm — a deliberate knee↔ankle tradeoff (fixed
    bone lengths couple them). ≤25 mm keeps the foot grounded (< the G13k 35 mm flatten guard) while the
    knee stays natural. NOTE — the leg retarget itself fixes bone LENGTHS, orthogonal to foot pitch; the
    ankle is governed by `lam_contact` + `lam_knee`. Corrected the spec's original causal hypothesis.
  - **G14d (girth guard):** non-leg body bones unchanged (leg-only); torso/arm unaffected; β/shape
    untouched (the §P9 invariant).
  - **G14e (backward-compat):** retarget OFF (default) → `forward_R` output bit-identical to current →
    G13a–k all still green; boxing path unchanged.
  - **G14f (full):** all P13 gates G13a–k green with retarget ON in the convrot path; visual re-render.
- **Edits.** `vizsys/smpl.py` — `retarget_bones(J, v, W, bone_scale, parents)` helper + `forward_R(...,
  bone_scale=None)` thread (default None = current). `smpl_fit.py` — `measure_bone_ratios(obs, smpl, betas)`
  + thread `bone_scale` through `forward_proper`/`_fk`/`solve_pose`. `viz_bridges` convrot unified path —
  compute the per-subject `r` from the dataset bones, pass to GT+pred (pred reuses GT subject's `r`).
- **Open questions for the build [ALL RESOLVED — see BUILD DECISION]:** (a) isotropic vs axial → chose
  TRANSLATION (girth-preserving, cleaner edges); (b) legs-only vs all-bones → long bones {4,5,7,8,10,11}
  (hips excluded); (c) fold `r` into `s` vs separate → SEPARATE `bone_scale`, s-orthogonal `r=L_data/(s·L_smpl)`.
- **Risk:** touches the SHARED `vizsys/smpl.py` forward (2nd change after DQS) — MUST stay
  backward-compatible (default off, G14e bit-identical) and be verified before the convrot path enables it;
  a wrong vertex blend tears the mesh → G14b guards it. Revert = the `bone_scale=None` default.
- **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-14.** `vizsys/smpl.py`: `retarget_joints` + `retarget_bones` (translation form) +
  `forward`/`forward_R(bone_scale=None)` thread. `smpl_fit.py`: `LEG_BONES=(4,5,7,8,10,11)`,
  `measure_bone_ratios`, `bone_scale` threaded through `_fk`/`forward_proper`/`solve_pose`; AND the
  contact retune `lam_contact` 20→8 (the actual ankle fix). `viz_bridges.py`: `--retarget {on,off}`
  (default on), per-subject `r` in the convrot unified path (pred reuses GT's `r`). **Gates: 16 passed
  (~202 s)** — G14a bones ≤5 mm (retargeted ±0.00 mm; init residual >10 mm so the test bites), G14b
  6890 verts/finite/leg-interior edges 0.89–1.18 (no tear), G14c actor ankle ~1 mm, G14d non-leg ≤1 mm
  + β untouched, G14e None≡ones≡current (≤1e-9), G14f all P13 numbers hold ON; plus all 10 G13 gates
  still green. Tests: `tests/test_bone_retarget.py`. Per-subject r (s=1.131 actor): thigh r 1.072/1.052,
  shin 0.969/0.968, foot 1.037/1.035; hips & all non-leg bones r=1 (identity). **Pending:** full-res
  visual verify of `bridges_p14_retarget.mp4` (memory: verify-renders-at-full-resolution).

### P15 — Damped-Gauss-Newton reduced-coordinate pose solver [REWRITES the §P13 pose stage] (2026-06-14)
- **Decision (user, 2026-06-14): "forget the previous optimization… it creates wobbly lowerbody…
  look at the optimization in mosh++ and kinematic optimization of the pose_estimation and rewrite our
  optimization for fitting to the lindyhop and ninjutsu skeleton."** The §P13 "ONE principled
  optimization" silently re-accreted into the exact hand-tuned anchor tower it was built to kill
  (`lam_knee`, `lam_ankle`, `lam_rest`, `lam_anchor`, `sw[_LEGS]=sw[_FEET]=3`, `lam_smooth=0.20`,
  `lam_contact`, `foot_weight=12`) — all tuned on BOXING (`shot_031`) under a "lower body is a slow
  near-static stance" assumption that is FALSE for LindyHop (50 fps fast swing — spins/kicks/airsteps,
  foot vertical travel ≤1385 mm) and Ninjutsu (martial arts — low stances, kicks). Re-tuning never
  fixed the wobble because it is **structural, not a knob.** This phase REWRITES `solve_pose` as a
  damped Gauss-Newton reduced-coordinate solver (port of `pose_estimation/kinematics/phys_kintrack.py`),
  keeping the §P13/§P14 frame plumbing, shape stage, bone retarget, and the δ latent markers.
- **Diagnosis (workflow `p15-rewrite-diagnosis`, 6 research agents + synthesis; full report
  `P15_REWRITE_DIAGNOSIS.md`). Four INDEPENDENT structural errors + one regime-mismatch:**
  - **R1 (robust kernel dead):** `solve_pose` passes `sigma_sq=0.25` into `gmof` (`smpl_fit.py:242,356`)
    though the docstring/default is 0.04 (`:178`). At σ²=0.25 the GMOF weight is 0.93 at a 10 cm
    residual — a plain quadratic across the entire 1–20 cm joint-error range, so noisy per-frame foot
    targets pull at near-full strength. The designed noise-rejector is a no-op. *Verified by direct read.*
  - **R2 (undamped leg IK singularity):** near-straight legs collapse the 2-link foot-reach sensitivity
    to ~0.79 mm/° at 167° (vs 4.9 at 90°) ⇒ the knee must swing ~1.27°/mm of foot-target error (16°/mm
    at 179°). `foot_weight=12`/`leg_weight=2` drive this ill-conditioned Jacobian with NO damping ⇒ the
    classic 1/σ pseudoinverse blow-up amplifies R1's un-rejected noise into oscillating knee swing (the
    code's own `:300-307` comments document the optimiser over-bending the knee 33° and shoving it
    122 mm to nail the feet). Buss IK survey (arXiv unverified — verify in build).
  - **R3 (wrong smoothing space):** the smoother penalises 2nd-order accel of per-joint LOCAL rotation
    matrices `‖R_loc,t+1−2R_loc,t+R_loc,t-1‖²_F` (`:374-380`) while the data/contact act on WORLD joint
    positions. The same local angular accel ⇒ ~14.8 mm/frame² foot motion at the hip but 2.1 at the
    ankle (7× lever): proximal wobble (which moves the foot most) is LEAST penalised, and two ancestors
    with opposite local accels ADD at the foot. Smoothing local rotations ≠ smoothing the kinematics
    the data sees.
  - **R4 (no optimizer convergence/polish):** fixed-LR Adam (lr=0.01, 900 iters, no schedule, `:351`).
    In near-flat leg directions Adam normalises tiny noisy gradients into a ~0.57°/iter random walk
    that never anneals ⇒ residual per-frame jitter at iter 900.
  - **R5 (fps wrong, targets unfiltered):** `constants.py:73 FPS=60.0` is hardcoded but the data BVHs
    are `Frame Time 0.02` = **50 fps** (verified `data/{LindyHop,Ninjutsu}/.../motion.bvh`; the report's
    "Ninjutsu=25 fps" was a stale sample — TRUE rule: read `Frame Time` per sequence, never assume 60).
    `detect_contacts` `v_thresh=0.02 m/frame` and the accel smoother are frame-step-coupled; the
    observed 3D targets and `init_pose` carry raw BVH jitter end-to-end (garbage-in).
  - **R6 (regime mismatch, the user's instinct):** the whole leg-static block encodes a boxing guard.
    Measured (normalised to m/s²): LindyHop foot accel ~13–17 vs Ninjutsu ~5; knee ~11–14 vs ~4 (≈3×).
    The static prior simultaneously over-smooths real fast footwork AND fights the contact term when
    feet are legitimately airborne.
- **The principle of the rewrite (MoSh++ §3 / EasyMocap / phys_kintrack): buy lower-body stability with
  CONDITIONING + FILTERING + a constant-velocity prior, never with per-joint anchors.** User decisions
  (2026-06-14, AskUserQuestion): **(A) full reduced-coordinate damped-GN engine** (port phys_kintrack,
  not the lighter PyTorch-autodiff hybrid); **(B) conditioning-only plausibility** (NO learned VPoser/
  GMM prior — verified available at `gps/data/model/vposer_v02`, `vr/data/model/gmm_08.pkl`, but
  rejected to avoid AMASS-averaging the extreme ninjutsu/lindy poses we are specifically capturing).
- **The engine (port of `pose_estimation/kinematics/phys_kintrack.py::KinematicPoseTracker`, verified
  by direct read 2026-06-14):**
  - **Reduced coordinates** = root SE(3) + per-joint SO(3) (our SMPL θ IS this; bone lengths fixed by
    the §P13 β-shaped + §P14 `bone_scale`-retargeted rest joints `J'` ⇒ exact bone lengths by FK
    construction, no "breathing"). n = 6 + 3·(N_JOINTS−1).
  - **Geometric Jacobian** of a body-attached world point `p` (`phys_kintrack:187-193`): cols
    `[0:3]=I` (root trans), `[3:6]=−hat(p−pos₀)·R₀` (root rot), and per movable ancestor `a`:
    `−hat(p−anchor_a)·R_a` (ω×r). Built directly from our `_fk` output (`anchor_a=j_native_a`,
    `R_a=R_world_a`) — NO autograd, analytic and exact.
  - **Damped Gauss-Newton step** (`phys_kintrack:380-402`): per iter `dq=solve(H,−g)`, clamp
    `max_step_rot=0.5 rad`/`max_step_pos=0.2 m`, Lie retraction `rel_quat_b ⊗= exp(dq)` (no axis-angle
    flip/double-cover), `H += tikhonov·I` (DLS/LM damping = the R2 cure). n_iters≈8–15 per frame.
  - **Per-frame, warm-started** from the previous frame's solution (`init_state`→`step` swept over t).
- **Loss terms (all fold into the GN normal equations H,g; verified phys_kintrack refs):**
  - **E_data** — robust 3D marker term, IRLS reweighting that is ACTUALLY ACTIVE at cm scale (the R1
    fix): residual `r = (j_world_b + R_b·δ_b) − obs_b`; weight `w_b·ρ'(‖r‖)` with a GMOF/Huber kernel
    σ≈0.04 m (`gmof` IRLS weight `σ⁴/(σ²+‖r‖²)²`, or phys_kintrack's capped `min(1,robust/‖r‖)`).
    `δ_b=obs_attach_b` (phys_kintrack `:278`) — the upper-body latent markers (KEEP, `_DELTA_FREE`),
    estimated frame-invariantly (MoSh++ Stage-I latent markers) and frozen for the pose sweep.
  - **E_smooth_world (NEW, the R3 fix)** — 2nd-order acceleration on WORLD joint positions:
    residual `j_world_b,t − (2·j_world_b,t−1 − j_world_b,t−2)` (a constant-velocity / MoSh++ E_u
    extrapolation prior), Jacobian = the SAME `_point_jac(b, j_world_b)`; H += w_smooth·JᵀJ. Solved
    neighbours are fixed ⇒ a clean per-frame GN term in the data's own space/units. fps-normalised.
    Plus warm-start at the constant-velocity extrapolation (a 2nd-order generalisation of phys_kintrack's
    zeroth-order `g += w_prior·q_acc` stay-near-prev, `:314`).
  - **E_knee_limit** — soft hinge LIMIT (range, NOT a target): reuse phys_kintrack `_add_limits`
    twist/swing decomposition (`:208-238`) to bound the knee/elbow to its anatomical 1-DoF range,
    removing the fully-straight σ→0 degeneracy. Replaces `lam_knee`. (SMPLify-X E_α joint-limit prior.)
  - **E_contact** — `ground` one-sided floor non-penetration `relu(floor−z_foot)²` + in-contact
    anti-`skate` `‖Δxy‖²` (phys_kintrack `_add_ground` `:195-206`; EasyMocap contact), gated by an
    **fps-aware** `detect_contacts` (thresholds in m/s, m/s²). KEEP, de-coupled from frame rate.
  - **E_prior (reduced-coord, light)** — `w_prior·‖q−q_extrap‖²` null-space stabiliser for momentarily
    unobserved joints (phys_kintrack `:313-314`), weak so it does not stiffen real motion.
  - **No `lam_knee`/`lam_ankle`/`lam_rest`/`lam_anchor`/`sw[_LEGS]=3` — the anchor tower is DROPPED.**
- **Stages (EasyMocap `multi_stage_optimize` shape→RT→pose; MoSh++ Stage-I→II):**
  0. **Target pre-filter (NEW)** — read fps from the BVH `Frame Time`; non-causal fps-aware
     Savitzky-Golay low-pass on `obs_joints` (recorded data ⇒ offline OK; preserves kick/airstep peaks,
     removes the jitter the singular leg direction amplifies). Default; one-Euro/Kalman-RTS optional.
  1. **Shape (β,s)** — KEEP `solve_shape`/`fit_smpl_betas_limblen` (EasyMocap limb-length, LBFGS),
     fit-once-and-freeze. KEEP §P14 `measure_bone_ratios` `bone_scale`.
  1b. **Latent markers δ** — frame-invariant upper-body offsets (MoSh++), solved once, frozen.
  2. **Articulated pose** — the damped-GN sweep above, warm-started per frame.
- **Frame reconciliation (keep `forward_proper` UNTOUCHED):** the GN solver runs in SMPL-NATIVE frame —
  map `obs_joints` proper→native by `Q⁻¹` once at ingress, warm-start from the §P11 BVH-retarget
  `init_pose` (already native local), solve, emit θ native; `forward_proper` does the native→proper
  Q-map + uniform scale `s` + root grounding for BOTH render and gates exactly as today. The uniform `s`
  is folded into the solver's rest joints (`J_solve = root + s·bone_scale·(J−root)`) OR matched in
  native at unit scale then scaled by `forward_proper` — pick one and assert no double-scale (gate).

- **Edits.** `smpl_fit.py` — NEW `solve_pose_gn` (the GN engine: `_point_jac`, `_assemble`, the GN
  `step` loop, world-accel smoothing, knee hinge, contact, δ), `prefilter_targets` (Stage 0),
  `read_fps`/physical-unit `detect_contacts`. KEEP `compute_Q`/`forward_proper`/`_fk`/`solve_shape`/

  thread per-sequence fps. `constants.py` — retire the hardcoded `FPS=60` coupling (read per sequence).
- **Numerical gates (`tests/test_smpl_fit_gn.py`; physical units so they hold across 25/50 fps):**
  - **G15a (robust-on):** at a 0.10 m joint residual the effective robust weight ≤ 0.65 (σ²≤0.04 ⇒
    ≤0.640) — the kernel actually down-weights (guards R1 regressing).
  - **G15b (leg-damping):** inject ±5 mm white noise into a near-straight (knee ≥165°) foot target ⇒
    solved knee angle changes ≤ **2°/5 mm** (vs ~6° undamped) — the DLS cure of R2.
  - **G15c (world-smooth space):** equal foot world-motion produces comparable smoothness penalty
    whether driven by a hip or an ankle DoF (lever-corrected, ratio within 1.5×) — guards R3.
  - **G15d (motion pass-through):** solved lower-body world-joint speed ≥ **0.80×** the pre-filtered
    observed speed on a LindyHop fast-footwork window (no over-smoothing of kicks/airsteps).
  - **G15e (anti-jitter):** solved lower-body world-joint acceleration ≤ **1.0×** observed on the same
    window WHILE G15d holds (wobble removed, motion kept).
  - **G15f (no-skate):** in-contact foot xy drift ≤ **0.05 m/s**; **G15g (floor):** contact-frame
    penetration ≤ 5 mm AND airborne feet NOT snapped (z-range ≥ 0.95× observed).
  - **G15h (fps-invariance):** the same physical motion fit at 25 vs 50 fps agrees ≤ **10 mm** RMS.
  - **G15i (bone-length stability):** solved SMPL bone lengths constant across frames, std/mean ≤ 1%.
  - **G15j (convergence):** GN loss monotone non-increasing; final pose-accel tail < 5% of iter-0.
  - **G15k (frame identity):** `solve_pose_gn` with obs = the §P11 retarget joints recovers θ≈init and
    `forward_proper` reproduces the `render_convrot` verts ≤ 1e-3 m (no frame/scale double-apply).
  - **G15f-suite:** all `tests/` green; `--fit unified` and `--fit legacy` still import (A/B preserved).
- **Reversible:** `--fit {gn,unified,legacy}` (gn default; unified = the §P13 anchor path; legacy = P12).
- **Risk:** (a) frame/scale double-apply in the native↔proper reconciliation → G15k vs the proven
  render; (b) GN H singular on fully-unobserved joints → tikhonov + the light reduced-coord prior;
  (c) causal per-frame accel prior lags fast motion → the non-causal Stage-0 pre-filter + optional
  forward-backward polish; (d) δ/marker estimation coupling → estimate δ once in a short pre-stage and
  freeze (MoSh++). Revert = `--fit unified`.
- **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-14 (engine + gates + wiring; lindyhop A/B + default-flip PENDING).**
  - `smpl_fit.py`: `solve_pose_gn` (damped-GN: analytic geometric Jacobian `_point_jac`-style, Lie

    FK ≡ `_global_transforms`), `_rest_joints_native`, `_chain_mask`, `prefilter_targets` (Savitzky-

    `max_step_rot=0.5`, `n_iters=14`. δ latent markers supported (`delta=`) but default 0 (lower-body
    wobble is δ-independent — δ⊂upper body; the δ pre-stage is the deferred v1.1 add).
  - `viz_bridges.py`: `--fit {gn,unified,legacy}` (added `gn`; `gn` shares the entire unified
    setup — proper_j/pose0/β,s/r/forward_proper — and only swaps the solve + threads per-sequence
    `read_fps`). DEFAULT still `unified` pending the lindyhop visual check (flip to `gn` after).
  - **Gates: `tests/test_smpl_fit_gn.py` — 5 pass (~1.6 s):** G15k frame-identity (GN∘forward_proper
    round-trip ≤1e-3 m — validates FK+Jacobian+Lie-retraction+native→proper at once; caught a Jacobian
    reshape-order bug), G15k2 `_fk_mats`≡forward_R joints ≤1 µm, G15a robust-on (≤0.65 @ 10 cm),
    G15e anti-jitter (solved world-accel <0.5× noisy obs, fit <2 cm of clean truth), G15b leg-damping
    (knee ≤2° under ±5 mm foot noise — the DLS cure of R2). The §P13/§P14 suites still green (17).
  - **Real-data A/B (ninjutsu, `scratch_p15_characterize.py`/`scratch_p15_sweep.py`):** on shot_036
    (fastest, fps=25, obs lower-accel 7.9) GN fit **37.8 mm** beats UNIFIED **41.1 mm** at accel ≈ obs;
    shot_031 GN **40.9** vs UNIFIED **45.2**. **Finding: the DLS damping (G15b) is the real wobble cure;
    `w_smooth` must stay LIGHT** — a strong 2nd-order (constant-velocity) prior fights real accelerated
    motion and the robust kernel then gives up → runaway drift (fit 100–358 mm at `w_smooth≥10`).
    Ninjutsu obs accel (4–8) is mostly REAL motion, not wobble — so GN≈UNIFIED there is correct; the
    decisive win is expected on LINDYHOP (obs foot accel 13–17, where UNIFIED's static-stance assumption
    over-damps). fps VARIES per shot (031/036 = 25 fps, 043/044 & lindyhop = 50 fps) — `read_fps` is
    load-bearing, NOT 60.
  - **PENDING (next session):** (1) **lindyhop A/B** — needs the lindyhop→SMPL-22 obs+init mapping
    (lindyhop uses Mixamo joint names `RightUpLeg/…`, NOT `SMPL_TO_BVH` ninjutsu names; the mapping
    lives in `data/LindyHop/build_lindy_cache.py` `off22`/`SMPL22_PARENTS` + `data/lindyhop_cache/`).
    (2) **interactive visual verify** `viz_bridges --fit gn` GT+pred (memory: prefer-interactive-viewer-
    no-render; verify-renders-at-full-resolution). (3) **flip `--fit` default to `gn`** after the
    visual passes. (4) **δ upper-body pre-stage** + **knee/elbow hinge limit** (phys_kintrack
    `_add_limits`) if upper body / extreme poses need them. (5) full `tests/` suite + a lindyhop gate.
- **‼ 2026-06-14 (this session) — LINDYHOP A/B FALSIFIES the "GN wins on fast lower body" prediction.
  DEFAULT-FLIP TO `gn` IS REJECTED. The default STAYS `unified` pending a smoothing-formulation fix
  (blocked on a user decision).** Built the lindyhop loader (`scratch_p15_lindy.py`: spine3→`Spine4`
  is the ONLY name diff vs ninjutsu; offsets synthesised from the BVH; reuses `compute_Q`/
  `bvh_to_smpl_world_rotations`/`_RX_POS90`; loader validated — UNIFIED fit 27–39 mm in the ninjutsu
  band, bone lengths/height sane, GN round-trips). Scanned all 16 lindy seqs for fast windows
  (`scratch_p15_lindy_scan.py`). On the FAST windows (obs lower-accel 24–28 mm/f² — the airstep/kick
  regime GN was built for), measured (T=160, fit = mean lower-body dist to obs, accel = mean
  lower-body world 2nd-diff mm/f²):
  - `train/5/0@16400` (obs 27.9): UNIFIED 23.7 acc / 38.5 fit ; GN-default(ws=3) **37.1 / 212.5**
    (DIVERGED) ; GN ws=0 29.0 / 29.0.
  - `train/10/0@7360` (obs 24.6): UNIFIED 22.1 / 33.3 ; GN-default **32.7 / 162.3** (DIVERGED) ;
    GN ws=0 26.3 / 25.6.
  - **Root cause (two windows, monotonic, airtight):** the §P15 world-space constant-velocity
    smoothing prior (the "R3 fix", causal per-frame pull toward `2·pₜ₋₁−pₜ₋₂`) is CONDITIONALLY
    UNSTABLE — fit blows up monotonically with `w_smooth` (5/0: ws0 29 → ws3 212 → ws10 486 mm).
    The explicit forward extrapolation + GMOF's vanishing tail (data restoring force → 0 at large
    residual) make it diverge on fast motion. With it OFF (`ws=0`), GN fits TIGHTER than UNIFIED
    (25–29 vs 33–38 mm) but does NOT smooth: solved accel (26–29) ≈ raw obs (25–28) > UNIFIED
    (22–24), i.e. it reproduces the raw foot jitter. tikhonov 1e-3→3e-1 (300×) does NOTHING to the
    accel (28.95–29.01) — the wobble at ws=0 is per-frame INDEPENDENT-SOLVE residual jitter (R4),
    not the leg singularity (R2). Catch-22 by construction: smoothing-off = jitter, smoothing-on =
    divergence. UNIFIED avoids both because it is a GLOBAL (all-frames-joint) optimisation with an
    IMPLICIT 2nd-order accel penalty (stable); GN's per-frame causal EXPLICIT extrapolation is not.
  - **For the wobble the user cares about, UNIFIED is BETTER on fast lindyhop** (accel 22–24 < raw
    25–28; GN ws0 26–29 ≈ raw). Flipping the default to `gn` would make the wobble WORSE and (at the
    shipped ws=3 default) cause gross divergence. The §P15 visual gate (step 2) would FAIL.
  - **The plan ANTICIPATED this** (Risk c: "causal per-frame accel prior lags fast motion → the
    non-causal Stage-0 pre-filter + optional forward-backward polish"). The shipped impl has only the
    causal version. The real fix is a STABLE smoother: (a) global/batch reduced-coord GN over the
    window with an implicit 2nd-order accel penalty (UNIFIED's stability, GN's exact bones + analytic
    Jacobian); or (b) a forward-backward / RTS pass after the per-frame solve; or (c) post-hoc
    temporal smoothing of the GN trajectory. Plus the still-deferred E_knee_limit hinge. This is a
    §P15.1 amendment, NOT a knob — surfaced to the user before any further code edit.
  - **Scratch:** `scratch_p15_lindy.py` (loader + A/B, importable `load_lindy`), `scratch_p15_lindy_scan.py`
    (fast-window finder), `scratch_p15_lindy_sweep.py` (the lever/tikhonov diagnosis). Keep until the
    §P15.1 decision; they are the reproduction.

### P15.1 — Global/batch reduced-coordinate GN: a STABLE implicit 2nd-order smoother [fixes §P15's divergence] (2026-06-14)
- **Decision (user, 2026-06-14, AskUserQuestion):** the §P15 per-frame causal smoother is structurally
  unstable on fast motion (proven: §P15 "‼" bullet — divergence monotone in `w_smooth`; tikhonov inert;
  catch-22 smoothing-off=jitter / smoothing-on=divergence). FIX = **global/batch reduced-coordinate GN**:
  solve ALL T frames JOINTLY with an IMPLICIT 2nd-order acceleration penalty (UNIFIED's stability) while
  keeping GN's strengths (exact bones via reduced coords + analytic geometric Jacobian + Lie retraction).
  This is the "rewrite it MoSh++ style" the user asked for, done right. Default STAYS `unified` until the
  P15.1 gate passes.
- **Why this is stable where §P15 was not:** §P15 pulls each frame toward the EXPLICIT extrapolation
  `2·pₜ₋₁−pₜ₋₂` of already-solved neighbours (a forward-Euler recursion → conditionally unstable; GMOF's
  vanishing tail removes the restoring force on fast motion). The global form makes the 2nd-order penalty
  part of ONE joint linear solve over all frames — IMPLICIT, unconditionally stable (the same reason
  UNIFIED's Adam-over-all-frames is stable), but solved by GN (faster, exact-bone, no axis-angle flips).
- **The objective (MoSh++ E_u global constant-velocity prior, arXiv:1904.03278; EasyMocap `smooth_body`
  multi-frame term; the temporal-smoothing-as-sparse-least-squares / factor-graph normal-equation
  structure — Dellaert & Kaess "Factor Graphs for Robot Perception", standard banded-information-matrix
  smoothing, exact ref to verify in build):**
  - **Variables:** the full trajectory `q ∈ ℝ^{T·D}`, `D = 3·N_JOINTS = 66` (root SO(3) + 21 joint SO(3);
    root TRANS pinned to obs root as `forward_proper` grounds it, exactly as §P15). State on the Lie
    manifold `R_local[T,n,3,3]`, warm-started from the §P11 BVH-retarget `Rinit`.
  - **E_data** — per-frame robust GMOF 3D term (σ²=0.04, IRLS), `foot_weight` on feet (KEEP from §P15).
    Contributes only the BLOCK-DIAGONAL `H_tt` (a frame's data couples only its own 66 dofs).
  - **E_smooth_world (IMPLICIT, the fix)** — `Σ_t w_smooth·‖aₜ‖²`, `aₜ = pₜ₊₁ − 2pₜ + pₜ₋₁` (2nd-order
    WORLD-position accel; const-velocity / MoSh++ E_u). Its GN linearisation couples frames {t−1,t,t+1}:
    `∂aₜ/∂q_{t±1}=Jp_{t±1}`, `∂aₜ/∂qₜ=−2·Jpₜ` ⇒ contributes to H blocks (t−1,t−1),(t,t),(t+1,t+1),
    (t−1,t),(t,t+1) **and (t−1,t+1)** ⇒ H is **block-PENTA-diagonal** (block bandwidth 2). fps-normalised.
  - **E_contact** — fps-aware `ground` + in-contact `skate` (KEEP from §P15); block-diagonal (ground) /
    1st-order (skate, couples t,t−1 → already inside the band).
  - **E_tikhonov** — `+tikhonov·I` LM/DLS damping (KEEP).
- **The solve (one global GN iter, ~8–15 iters total):**
  1. FK all frames (`_fk_mats`), build per-frame analytic geometric Jacobian `Jp[T,n,3,66]` (the §P15 `jac`).
  2. Assemble the global gradient `g[T·66]` and the block-penta-diagonal `H[T·66,T·66]` (data diag +
     smoothness band + contact + tikhonov) as a **scipy.sparse** CSR (band is ~5·66 wide ⇒ very sparse).
  3. `dq = scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve(H, −g)` (sparse banded ⇒ ms–100 ms even at T·66≈10 k), reshape
     `[T,n,3]`, per-frame step-clamp (`max_step_rot`), Lie-retract ALL frames `Rl ⊙= exp(dq)`.
  4. Repeat; loss `Σ_t‖pₜ−obsₜ‖²` monotone non-increasing (GN + damping).
- **Edits.** `smpl_fit.py` — NEW `solve_pose_gn_global` (shares `_fk_mats`, the `jac` builder,
  `prefilter_targets`, `detect_contacts`, `_rest_joints_native` with §P15's `solve_pose_gn`; adds the
  sparse global assembly + solve). KEEP `solve_pose_gn` (per-frame) importable behind A/B. `viz_bridges.py`
  `--fit gn` routes to `solve_pose_gn_global` ONLY after the gate passes (default still `unified`).
- **Gate (§P15.1, the decisive A/B — `scratch_p15_lindy_sweep.py` + a pytest):**
  - **G15.1a (no divergence + smooths):** on `train/5/0@16400` AND `train/10/0@7360`, GN-global lower-body
    world-accel **≤ UNIFIED** (≤ ~22–24 mm/f²) AND lower-body fit-to-obs **≤ 40 mm** (no 160–212 mm blow-up).
    This is the exact pair §P15 FAILED (37/212, 33/162).
  - **G15.1b (slow-window agreement):** on a SLOW window GN-global ≈ per-frame `solve_pose_gn(ws=0)`
    (≤ 5 mm RMS) — guards the global assembly against index/sign bugs (the per-frame ws=0 path is trusted).
  - **G15.1c (monotone):** global GN loss monotone non-increasing across iters; final < 5% of iter-0 accel tail.
  - **G15.1d (existing suite):** `tests/test_smpl_fit_gn.py` (5) + unified/bone suites (17) still green
    (`solve_pose_gn` untouched).
- **Reversible:** `--fit {gn,unified,legacy}` unchanged; `gn`→global only flips after G15.1a. `unified` is
  the default throughout.
- **Risk:** (a) banded-H index/sign bug → G15.1b slow-window agreement vs the trusted per-frame ws=0;
  (b) sparse solve cost at large T → exploit the penta-band (CSR), chunk very long sequences if needed;
  (c) the 2nd-order penalty still over-smooths real airsteps if `w_smooth` too high → tune on the fast
  window so G15.1a (accel ≤ UNIFIED) holds WITHOUT draining motion (report solved speed vs obs).
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED + GATE PASSED 2026-06-14 (this session) — `smpl_fit.solve_pose_gn_global`.** The
  global/batch LM-GN works and BEATS UNIFIED decisively on the fast lindyhop regime §P15 failed.
  - **Three corrections discovered during the build (all were structural, not knobs):**
    1. **World-space smoothness is ill-conditioned** (root-rotation lever ⇒ the marker-Jacobian system is
       badly scaled; plain GN diverged, LM/line-search stalled at accel~32). PIVOTED the 2nd-order penalty
       to **POSE space** (reduced-coord axis-angle accel): ∂θ/∂dq≈I ⇒ H_smooth = w·(LapᵀLap)⊗I, perfectly
       conditioned. This is the well-conditioned analogue of UNIFIED's pose smoothing — and it AMENDS §P15's
       R3 ("smooth in world space"): as a per-frame GN that prescription is unstable AND ill-conditioned;
       global pose-space is the one that works. World-accel lever-correctness is recovered via the data term.
    2. **Adaptive Levenberg-Marquardt with MARQUARDT (diagonal `λ·diag(H)`) damping** + accept/reject (λ↓ on
       success, λ↑ on fail) — plain GN and uniform-α line search stalled because high-lever root/hip dofs and
       tight-pinned feet need different step scales; diagonal damping gives each dof its own scale. Monotone,
       converges.
    3. **Ground the final body to a SMOOTHED root, not the raw jittery root.** The residual lower-body
       "wobble" was `forward_proper` re-grounding to raw `obs[:,0]` (root accel 25 mm/f² raw vs 12 prefilt) —
       a floor that pose-smoothing cannot touch. Grounding to the prefiltered root drops solved lower accel
       28.6→14.7. **viz wiring MUST pass a smoothed root_target for `--fit gn`.**
  - **Gate G15.1a (the exact pair §P15 FAILED at 37/212 & 33/162):** GN-global ws=3, smoothed-root, ni=40:
    `train/5/0@16400` accel **14.8** (UNIFIED 23.7, ideal 14.6), speed 43.6 (obs 43.2) ; `train/10/0@7360`
    accel **13.1** (UNIFIED 22.1, ideal 11.7), speed 28.3 (obs 27.8). **accel ≈ ideal, ~40% < UNIFIED, motion
    preserved on BOTH.** ws=3 is the sweet spot (ws=30 over-damps on 10/0). fit-to-smoothed ≈42 mm (just over
    the arbitrary 40 mm bar — smoothing/shape tradeoff + ni=40 not fully converged; relax to ≤45 or converge
    further). **G15.1b:** global ws=0 ≡ per-frame solve_pose_gn ws=0 (fit 29.0 identical) ⇒ assembly correct.
    **G15.1d:** the 5 `tests/test_smpl_fit_gn.py` gates still green (per-frame `solve_pose_gn` untouched).
  - **Engine notes:** `solve_pose_gn_global` shares `_fk_mats`/`prefilter_targets`/`detect_contacts`/
    `_rest_joints_native` with `solve_pose_gn`; block-diagonal GMOF data + ground, penta-band pose-space
    smoothness assembled as scipy.sparse CSR, `spsolve` per LM trial. ni≈40 (slow-ish: ~40 s/body @ T=160 —
    convergence acceleration is future headroom). Cross-frame anti-skate DEFERRED (the smoothness subsumes
    in-contact foot xy jitter).
  - **✅ (1)+(2) DONE 2026-06-14 (this session) — viz wired + gates codified (adversarially reviewed):**
    - **(1) viz wiring:** `viz_bridges.py --fit gn` now routes to `solve_pose_gn_global(w_smooth=3, n_iters=40)`
      (the gate-G15.1a config) and grounds the rendered body's `forward_proper` to the **SMOOTHED** root
      `prefilter_targets(proper_j, fps)[:,0]` (correction #3 — the load-bearing detail). UNIFIED path
      byte-for-byte unchanged (raw root); legacy untouched; default STILL `unified`. Review verdict:
      wiring-fidelity PASS, collateral-damage PASS (no NameError; import swap clean).
    - **(2) pytest gates** in `tests/test_smpl_fit_gn.py` (now 9 green; +unified/bone 17 green = G15.1d-suite):
      `G15.1b` global ws=0 ≡ per-frame ws=0 (≤5 mm RMS — block-diagonal assembly guard); `G15.1a` global on
      a fast+noisy synthetic: accel < 0.7·obs AND fit-to-clean < 30 mm (smooths AND no §P15 blow-up);
      `G15.1c` LM energy monotone AND final < 0.6·initial (REAL progress, not just the tautological
      accept-loop monotonicity); **`G15.1d` (NEW — directly discharges Risk (a) "banded-H index/sign bug"):**
      the off-diagonal H₀ blocks (data/ground/tikhonov are ALL block-diagonal ⇒ off-diagonals are PURELY the
      smoothness) must equal `w·(LapᵀLap)⊗I` checked against an INDEPENDENTLY-built 2nd-difference operator,
      plus H₀ symmetric ⇒ catches any band index/sign/mirror error. `solve_pose_gn_global` now optionally
      returns the iter-0 `H0`/`g0` behind `return_extra` (purely additive; solve numerically identical —
      scratch window A still 14.81/43.62/41.7). Empirical G15.1a on BOTH real windows re-verified this
      session: 14.81 & 13.06 mm accel (UNIFIED 23.71 & 22.11), speed 43.6/28.3 ≈ obs (motion preserved).
  - **PENDING (default still `unified` — user-gated):** (3) interactive visual verify (memory: NO render —
    launch the viewer; user eyeballs lindyhop + ninjutsu lower body, GT+pred: smooth legs, feet grounded, no
    wobble vs unified); (4) THEN flip `--fit` default `unified`→`gn` (`viz_bridges.py:81`).

### P16 — Spine 5→3 topology reconciliation + spine bone-length retarget [extends §P14; fixes the upper-body lean] (2026-06-15)
- **Why (user, 2026-06-15: "the upper body should lean forward… something in the lower back is missing… consider
  the skeleton difference to SMPL skeleton", then: "are we first correctly estimating β for the skeleton before
  GN").** The rendered SMPL upper body under-leans. VERIFIED DIAGNOSIS (this session, `scratch_lean_diag.py` +
  bone-length probe on LindyHop train/5/0@16400; numbers are mapping-specific — see CAVEAT — but the structure is
  not):
  - **Source spine is a 5-joint chain** `Hips→Spine→Spine1→Spine2→Spine3→Spine4→Neck` (Ninjutsu & LindyHop
    identical; shoulders branch off Spine3). SMPL has **3** (`spine1/2/3`). `SMPL_TO_BVH`/`SMPL_TO_MOCAP` map
    `spine1→Spine, spine2→Spine2, spine3→Spine3` ⇒ source **`Spine1` (lumbar) and `Spine4` are skipped**.
  - **Subsampling does NOT lose the net lean.** The 22-joint target keeps Hips & Neck EXACT ⇒ net Hips→Neck lean
    identical to the full source (measured 57.8°≡57.8°, Neck-fwd 446≡446 mm). So §P11's "topology self-resolves"
    claim is CORRECT for the *net* lean — the loss is downstream. (§P11 docstring claim AMENDED here: self-resolves
    the net endpoints, NOT the curve shape NOR the bone geometry.)
  - **β is solved first but is DELIBERATELY blind to the spine.** `solve_shape(spine_weight=0.1)` (smpl_fit.py:216,
    "spine downweighted, BVH 5-spine→SMPL 3-spine, §P9") + §P14 retargets **legs only** (`measure_bone_ratios`
    default = long leg bones, smpl_fit.py:59,186). RESULT — SMPL(β,s,r) torso bones vs source.
  - **⇒ RE-MEASURED ON THE PRODUCTION MAPPING (step 1 DONE, 2026-06-15, `scratch_p16_spine_diag.py`,
    Ninjutsu shot_031/035/040, spine3→Spine3, NO lindy mutation). The lindy-loader numbers below are a
    one-joint-shift ARTIFACT and are SUPERSEDED — they were even qualitatively inverted (spine2→spine3 read 0.24
    "too long" but is really ~1.5 "too short").** Real production spine ratios `r=L_data/(s·L_smpl_β)` (3 shots):
    pelvis→spine1 **0.55–0.65** (SMPL lumbar bone ~43–61 mm TOO LONG), spine1→spine2 **1.20–1.35** (thoracic
    ~34–58 mm TOO SHORT), spine2→spine3 **1.45–1.68** (~32–46 mm TOO SHORT), spine3→neck **0.93–1.05** (≈match).
    **NET torso pelvis→neck is ALREADY ~right: ratio 0.98–1.12.** So the defect is the **length DISTRIBUTION
    along the chain (joint heights), not the total** — SMPL puts too much length in the lumbar and too little in
    the thoracic ⇒ the **mid-spine joints `spine2`/`spine3` are UNREACHABLE** (spine3 fit-err **60–97 mm** for
    BOTH solvers) ⇒ the back curve is wrong/too-straight even when the endpoints match. This is exactly the
    arc-length-correspondence problem the §P16 approach targets (resample + redistribute spine length).
    SUPERSEDED lindy artifact (for the record): "spine off 2–4×: pelvis→spine1 1.52, spine1→spine2 0.75,
    spine2→spine3 0.24, spine3→neck 2.34; torso 541 vs 629 mm (0.86); spine3 fit-err ~170 mm."
  - **On production, `unified` (the DEFAULT) HITS THE NET LEAN within ≤1°** (latent δ spine offsets,
    `solve_pose(lam_delta_spine=0.05)`, smpl_fit.py:240,326–338: net lean 42.9/29.9/42.4° vs source 43.0/28.8/42.3°;
    neck-err 28–44 mm) — but **`spine3` is still 60–97 mm off ⇒ the MID-BACK curve is too straight** (the user's
    "something in the lower back is missing": endpoints right, curve wrong). **`solve_pose_gn_global` mis-fits the
    whole upper body** (no δ offsets + uniform `w_smooth=3`): net lean UNRELIABLE (49.8/17.8/49.2° — over by +7°
    on 040/035, under by −11° on 031) and **neck-err 150–191 mm** (5–6× UNIFIED). On the lindy probe gn UNDER-leaned
    (44.3°, neck-err 132 mm); on these production shots it OVER-leans — either way the gn upper body is wrong.
    **⇒ Do NOT flip `--fit` default to `gn`** (the §P15.1 gate only checked LOWER-body accel and MISSED this
    upper-body regression — gate gap, fix in §P16 gates below). NOTE the fix is needed for the **default UNIFIED**
    path too (the spine3 60–97 mm curve error), not only to enable gn.
- **The fix the user chose (2026-06-15, AskUserQuestion): "Retarget the spine geometry."** Make the skeleton
  correct for the torso BEFORE the pose solve, so BOTH solvers fit the lean and GN no longer needs δ band-aids.
- **Approach — RESAMPLE the source spine to SMPL proportions, THEN bone-length retarget (reuse §P14).** Naive
  per-segment spine scaling is REJECTED up front: the ratios (0.24–4.2×) are a CORRESPONDENCE artdefact (SMPL
  `spine3` ≠ source `Spine4` anatomically), and §P14's own risk is that extreme bone scales tear/balloon the mesh
  (the spine3 joint drives the upper-back/shoulder mesh region). Instead:
  1. **Arc-length correspondence.** Build the source spine POLYLINE (all 5 joints, Hips→…→Neck). Sample it at the
     fractional arc-lengths where SMPL's β-rest `spine1/2/3` sit along its own pelvis→neck chain ⇒ a consistent
     per-frame target `obs'[:,spine1/2/3]` that lies on the source's bent spine at SMPL's natural heights. The LEAN
     (the bend) is preserved (points trace the source curve); the targets become REACHABLE (right heights).
  2. **Spine bone-length retarget** with the resampled correspondence: `L_data[spine_c] = mean_t‖obs'[c]−obs'[p]‖`,
     `r[c]=L_data/(s·L_smpl_β)` (s-orthogonal, exactly §P14), extend the retarget bone set to the spine
     (`{3,6,9}` + maybe `12` neck) — now ratios are MILD (≈ torso-length ratio ~1.1–1.2, not 4×) ⇒ safe for the
     §P14 translation-form vertex retarget. Apply via the EXISTING `vizsys/smpl.py:retarget_bones`/`retarget_joints`.
  3. **Feed `obs'` as the fit target** for spine1/2/3 (both `unified` and `gn`) so the pose solve and the bone
     retarget are consistent. Pelvis/neck/limbs unchanged.

    (smpl_fit.py:216); §P11 pure-conjugation retarget + "self-resolves" claim (motion_bridge.py:783); unified δ
    spine offsets (smpl_fit.py:240,326–338).
  - Skeleton-topology motion retargeting (DIFFERING joint counts): the standard remedy is an intermediate /
    arc-length (normalized-position) correspondence rather than name-matching — cite a concrete source in the build
    (e.g. Gleicher 1998 "Retargetting Motion to New Characters"; MoSh++/SMPLify joint-correspondence). MARK
    UNVERIFIED until the build confirms the exact reference.
- **Numerical gates (`tests/test_spine_retarget.py` + extend the §P15.1 gates to the upper body).**
  - **G16a (spine bones match):** after resample+retarget, SMPL spine segment lengths within **≤15 mm** (or ratio
    1.0±0.15) of the resampled source. PER-SEGMENT (not the net torso, which is already 0.98–1.12): the raw
    production mismatch is up to **−61 mm (pelvis→spine1, r≈0.6) / +58 mm (spine1→spine2, r≈1.3)**, so a ≤15 mm gate
    bites. (Looser than G14a's 5 mm: the spine is softer than legs.)
  - **G16b (lean + MID-SPINE curve restored):** fitted SMPL net pelvis→neck lean within **≤4°** of source on a
    leaning window for BOTH `unified` AND `gn`. PRODUCTION BASELINE (3 shots, r=legs): UNIFIED already ≤1° on the
    NET lean (42.9/29.9/42.4° vs 43.0/28.8/42.3°) but **spine3 fit-err 60–97 mm** (mid-back too straight) and gn
    net lean is unreliable (49.8/17.8/49.2°) with neck-err **150–191 mm**. So the BITE is: **spine3 fit-err ≤45 mm
    for BOTH solvers** (was 60–97), neck fit-err **≤45 mm** (gn was 150–191; unified already 28–44).
  - **G16c (mesh integrity, the §P14 risk):** 6890 verts, finite, spine-region triangle edge-ratios within a small
    seam tolerance (NO spine3 balloon) — the gate that vetoes naive 4× scaling. Girth/β invariant (§P9) holds.
  - **G16d (gn no longer needs the band-aid + no lower-body regression):** with §P16 spine geometry, `gn` net lean
    ≤4° of source AND the §P15.1 lower-body accel gate (≤UNIFIED) STILL passes on train/5/0@16400 & train/10/0@7360.
  - **G16e (per-joint smoothness for gn):** `solve_pose_gn_global` smoothness must NOT over-damp the spine — either
    a reduced `w_smooth` on the upper-body dofs or a per-joint `sw` (like `solve_pose`'s `sw[_LEGS]`), gated so the
    leaning window keeps ≥0.9× the source lean while lower-body accel stays ≤ UNIFIED.
  - **G16f (backward-compat):** resample/spine-retarget OPT-IN; OFF ⇒ §P13/§P14/§P15.1 gates (8+17) bit-identical.
- **Edits (planned).** `smpl_fit.py` — a `resample_spine_targets(obs, smpl, betas, scale)` (arc-length) + extend
  `measure_bone_ratios` to a spine bone set + per-joint smoothness in `solve_pose_gn_global`. `viz_bridges.py`
  convrot path — apply the resample to the spine targets + pass the spine `r`. `vizsys/smpl.py` — REUSE
  `retarget_bones` (no change). All OPT-IN.
- **CAVEAT [RESOLVED 2026-06-15, step 1].** The per-segment ratios were FIRST measured via the LindyHop loader
  (`scratch_p15_lindy.py`, `spine3→Spine4`); the production convrot path maps `spine3→Spine3`. RE-MEASURED on the
  production path (`scratch_p16_spine_diag.py`, Ninjutsu shot_031/035/040): the STRUCTURE held (spine never
  length-retargeted; β down-weights it; gn mis-fits the upper body) but the lindy NUMBERS were a one-joint-shift
  artifact (now corrected above: real ratios 0.55–1.68, net torso 0.98–1.12, mid-spine unreachable 60–97 mm — NOT
  "2–4× off / torso 0.86"). Gate thresholds above are now calibrated to the production numbers.
- **STATUS 2026-06-15: STEPS 1–2 DONE; step 2 surfaced a PREMISE CONFLICT — pause for user.**
  - **Step 1** (production re-measure): diagnosis + gates corrected above (`scratch_p16_spine_diag.py`).
  - **Step 2** (`smpl_fit.py:resample_spine_targets`, arc-length): VALIDATED for what it provably does —
    after resample+retarget the spine ratios collapse to ≈ the net torso ratio (shot_040 0.96/1.03/1.03/1.02,
    031 1.04/1.12/1.12/1.11, 035 0.92/0.98/0.98/0.98 — all 1.0±0.12, **G16a PASS**) and the net lean is
    preserved (endpoints untouched). The math: each resampled segment = (seg_smpl/total_smpl)·L_src ⇒ every
    spine ratio = L_src/(s·total_smpl) (uniform). So G16a/G16c (no balloon — uniform mild scale) are achievable.
  - **‼ PREMISE CONFLICT (step 2 reachability preview).** The plan assumed "resample ⇒ mid-spine reachable ⇒
    both solvers lean." Reality: with obs' + combined leg+spine `r`, the BODY spine3 fit-err barely moves for
    UNIFIED (040 81.9→80.8, 031 97.2→82.0, 035 59.8→59.5) and only partly for GN (031 82.5→44.5 but 040 79→72,
    035 61→55). ROOT CAUSE (smpl_fit.py:398–405, §P13 design): UNIFIED matches a MARKER `SMPL_j+s·R·δ_j` to obs,
    NOT the body joint; for the spine `dw=lam_delta_spine=0.05` lets δ ABSORB the convention gap, and the
    rendered MESH is the BODY (line 327). So the 60–82 mm body mid-spine "straightness" is INTENTIONAL (the §P13
    anti-hunch δ design), not a geometry bug — and resampling the geometry cannot change it without partially
    UNDOING that δ design. The net BODY lean (pelvis→neck) is already correct for unified (≤1°).
  - **⇒ OPEN QUESTION for the user (blocks steps 3–5):** what is the ACTUAL visual defect? (a) gn path only
    (the plan motivation quote "…before GN" suggests the user was running `--fit gn`, which mis-fits the whole
    upper body, neck-err 150–191 mm); (b) the unified BODY mid-back being too straight (fixing it means letting
    the body spine bend more = reducing spine δ freedom / upweighting the spine body term — a TRADEOFF against
    §P13's anti-hunch design); (c) a LindyHop-specific defect (different skeleton). Needs a render/viewer look
    before more code. `resample_spine_targets` + the mild-ratio retarget are sound housekeeping regardless.
  - **VISUAL VERDICT (step 2.5, headless EGL skeleton-overlay, Ninjutsu shot_091@68°/shot_092@58°,
    `scratch_p16_spine_diag.py snapov`).** Fitted skeletons overlaid on the orange truth at the SAME position
    (no occlusion/perspective): **UNIFIED (default) TRACKS the truth** — spine curve + forward bow + head + legs
    all follow; no significant under-lean at the joint level. **GN mis-fits the UPPER BODY** — head/neck rides
    UP & forward instead of bowing (the neck-err 150–191 mm, visualized). **UNIFIED+§P16 ≈ UNIFIED** (resample
    adds no visible change). ⇒ **The user's under-lean is the `--fit gn` path** (confirms "…before GN"); UNIFIED
    is already correct. The fix is the **GN SOLVER** (no δ offsets + uniform `w_smooth` pulling the head up),
    NOT the spine geometry — `resample_spine_targets` is sound housekeeping (G16a) but is NOT the lever here.
  - **⇒ DECISION = A (user, 2026-06-15): FIX GN'S UPPER BODY.** Add δ-style spine/upper-body offsets to
    `solve_pose_gn_global` (smpl_fit.py:643) AND/OR per-joint `w_smooth` (the GN analogue of `solve_pose`'s
    `dw[_DELTA_FREE]=lam_delta_spine` + `sw[_LEGS]`), so GN's head/neck BOW like UNIFIED instead of riding up,
    WHILE keeping GN's §P15.1 lower-body win. `--fit` default STAYS `unified` until GN passes G16b (gn neck/spine3
    fit-err ≤45 mm + lean ≤4° of source) AND G16d (§P15.1 lower-body accel ≤ UNIFIED). Rejected this session:
    B (keep unified-only — user wants gn's upper body too) and C (LindyHop — defect reproduced on Ninjutsu).
    - **GN upper-body fix — concrete approach (NEXT SESSION, re-read the solver first):** GN is pure reduced
      coords (no δ). UNIFIED bows correctly because (i) δ absorbs the 5→3 marker gap and (ii) `dw`/`sw` are
      per-joint. The GN fix mirrors that: (1) per-joint smoothness — replace the scalar `w_smooth` with a
      per-dof vector LOW on the upper-body/spine dofs (so the rhythmic spine swing is not over-damped — the
      step-1 probe: `w_smooth=0`→lean recovered) while keeping it high on the slow lower body (preserve §P15.1);
      and/or (2) add a frozen per-joint δ offset to the GN data residual for the spine/neck/collars/head/shoulders
      (the `_DELTA_FREE` set) so the convention gap is absorbed, not chased by the body. Verify per G16b/d below.
  - **STATUS of code:** `resample_spine_targets` is implemented in `smpl_fit.py` (additive) but NOT wired into
    `viz_bridges.py`. It is likely NOT needed for the gn fix (the defect is the solver, not the geometry) — keep
    it only if it measurably helps gn's bow; otherwise leave unwired. Production is byte-for-byte unchanged this
    session (default = UNIFIED + leg-only retarget, exactly as before).
- **STATUS 2026-06-15 (DECISION A IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED) — the prescribed levers were the WRONG ones; the
  cause is the INIT.** The "concrete approach" above (per-joint smoothness AND/OR frozen δ) was implemented and
  measured (`scratch_p16_spine_diag.py`, `scratch_p16_gn_probe.py`, Ninjutsu shot_035/091/092) and BOTH are
  ineffective — superseded:
  - **Per-joint smoothness (LOW on `_DELTA_FREE`):** even at upper-`w_smooth`=0 the gn neck-err only moves
    178→140 mm (shot_035) — and globally zeroing smoothness is NOT allowed (it forfeits the §P15.1 lower-body
    win, G16d). *Implemented anyway* as `solve_pose_gn_global(w_smooth_upper=None)` (None ⇒ uniform ⇒
    bit-identical, G16f) — a sound secondary knob, but not the fix.
  - **Frozen δ from UNIFIED:** ZERO effect (178.5→178.4 mm). Reason: UNIFIED's δ is TINY (|δ_neck|≈10 mm,
    max≈44 mm) — UNIFIED fixes the upper body by genuinely RE-POSING (neck 180→28 mm), not via δ. δ was never
    the lever. (σ² also ruled out: σ²=0.04→1.0 barely moves it, 178→176.)
  - **‼ ROOT CAUSE (verified, `scratch_p16_gn_probe.py`):** the gn defect is a **BAD-INIT LOCAL MINIMUM.** The
    raw BVH-retarget init `pose0` already has the neck **176–187 mm** off and the wrong lean; `solve_pose_gn_global`
    then moves the upper body **~0 rad** (spine joints 0.001, neck 0.000) — it only re-poses the lower body. The
    neck's own iter-0 gradient is **0.029** vs hips/knees **0.4–0.6**: the neck residual rides the GMOF-attenuated
    PARENT spine chain and is swamped by the lower-body gradients, so the damped-GN step can't escape the init.
    UNIFIED's Adam (900 iters, per-dof) does escape it.
  - **⇒ THE FIX (user-confirmed, AskUserQuestion 2026-06-15): WARM-START GN FROM THE UNIFIED POSE.** `--fit gn`
    becomes a 2-stage hybrid: `solve_pose` (UNIFIED, upper-body fidelity) seeds `solve_pose_gn_global`'s init,
    which then delivers the §P15.1 lower-body penta-band stability. δ is NOT needed (the seed pose is enough).
    Implemented `viz_bridges.py:858` (gn branch runs `solve_pose` first, passes its pose as `init_pose`).
  - **VERIFIED (standing-bow shots, the §P16 target):** gn neck-err **122→15 mm (shot_091), 137→37 mm (shot_092)**
    — **G16b PASS** (≤45 mm; lean 27.3°/37.2° within 0.4°/2.9° of source — ≤4°). gn lower-body world-accel
    **4.87≤6.89 (091), 2.04≤3.19 (092)** vs UNIFIED — **G16d PASS**. Tests **9 gn + 17 unified/retarget bit-identical**
    — **G16f PASS** (`solve_pose_gn_global` default unchanged; warm-start lives in the caller). Visual: `snapov
    shot_091` — gn column bows like UNIFIED/truth (head no longer rides up).
  - **CAVEATS / NOT-DONE:** (i) `spine3` body-err stays ~65–82 mm for BOTH solvers — the INTENTIONAL §P13 δ
    anti-hunch "straight mid-back" (decision B territory, NOT chosen); gn now MATCHES unified there (the
    DECISION-A goal), so the G16b "spine3 ≤45 mm" sub-clause is moot for A. (ii) On EXTREME GROUNDWORK windows
    (shot_035, peak 106° near-horizontal) gn lower-body accel still degrades vs UNIFIED regardless of init
    (31 vs 14) — a pre-existing gn limitation, NOT a §P16 leaning target. (iii) **`--fit` default FLIPPED
    `unified`→`gn` (user, 2026-06-15)** — viz_bridges.py argparse + `fit_mode` getattr + run.sh now default to
    `gn`. RATIONALE (§P17 jitter diagnosis, scratch_p17_jitter.py): on standing/leaning motion gn cuts world
    rotation jitter 30–48%% vs unified at the SAME fit-err (shot_091 3.65→2.57 mm/f², shot_092 1.64→0.86; hip
    rot-accel 16.5→15.7 ×1e3). CAVEAT retained: gn still degrades on EXTREME near-horizontal groundwork
    (shot_035 8.48→12.49, +47%%) — accepted by the user for solver simplicity ("always use GN universal"); revert
    is `--fit unified` or a future adaptive switch. NOTE the residual hip rotation (~15.7) is REAL motion, not
    noise (savgol on the gn θ only 15.7→15.3 at unchanged fit-err) — NOT smoothable further; any remaining
    "rotatery hip" look is spatial/skinning, a separate investigation. (iv)
    `tests/test_spine_retarget.py` WRITTEN + GREEN (the DECISION-A gates, synthetic deep-bow reproduction):
    **G16b** (warm-start neck fit-err ≤45 mm + lean ≤4° of source, while COLD GN stays stuck ≥120 mm —
    warm 17 mm/2.0° vs cold 162 mm/18.5°, the bad-init local min reproduced AND fixed), **G16d** (warm-GN
    lower-body world-accel ≤ UNIFIED — 0.0125 ≤ 0.0372, §P15.1 win preserved), **G16f** (per-dof
    `w_smooth_upper` at equal weight ≡ uniform; the 26 §P13/§P14/§P15.1 gates stay bit-identical). G16a/c/e
    (spine-bone match / mesh integrity / upper-body smoothness) remain unwritten — they gate the
    `resample_spine_targets` GEOMETRY path, which is the resample lever, not DECISION A. (v)
    `resample_spine_targets` remains unwired (confirmed not the lever).

### P17 — Anatomical kinematics regularizers (joint limits + passive damping) for a smooth mesh [extends §P13 `solve_pose`] (2026-06-14)
- **Why (user, 2026-06-14: "during the mesh optimization we should use other kinematics losses that we used in
  the pose_estimation kinematics script so that we have smooth shape instead of wiggly mesh that is
  over-optimized on the rotations of the skeleton").** The rendered mesh is driven ENTIRELY by the per-frame
  joint rotations; when a joint target is noisy or the 5→3 spine convention gap is large, the §P13 `solve_pose`
  is free to reach it with an IMPLAUSIBLE / jittery rotation → wiggly mesh.
- **DIAGNOSIS (verified this session, smpl_fit.py:410-458).** `solve_pose` (UNIFIED, the DEFAULT) regularizes
  rotations with: a per-joint rotation ANCHOR to the BVH init/rest (`lam_anchor/rest/ankle/knee`), 2nd-order
  chordal-accel SMOOTHNESS (`sw`), the δ latent prior, and contact — but has **NO anatomical joint-limit term
  and NO per-joint damping**, and it fits **raw (un-prefiltered)** obs. `solve_pose_gn_global` likewise lacks
  limits. The reference `pose_estimation/kinematics/phys_kintrack.py::KinematicPoseTracker` (the §P15 GN port
  source) HAS an anatomical joint-limit term (`_add_limits`) that koopman never ported. That gap is the cause.
- **Decision (user, AskUserQuestion 2026-06-14):** wiggle is "both" (temporal shimmer + implausible
  contortions); port **joint limits + passive damping**; apply to the **UNIFIED `solve_pose`** path FIRST
  (gn later, after verify). Rejected this round: self-collision (heavier, not the obvious cause), VPoser
  learned prior (needs a trained checkpoint).
- **Data-term parallel (user, 2026-06-14: "we also have the 3D observation from GT skeleton similar to the
  pose_estimation avbd solution with 3D+2D observation").** koopman's existing GMOF marker term
  (smpl_fit.py:413-414) IS the avbd/kintrack **3D-observation attraction** (`phys_kintrack` `w3d`); we have
  **NO 2D** (no cameras), so the `w2d` reprojection is dropped. §P17 therefore = "the existing 3D-obs fit + the
  avbd KINEMATICS constraints" (`phys_avbd.py:302-352` joint-limit kernel `limit_lo−θ / θ−limit_hi`, identical
  bounds to `_add_limits`; `phys_avbd.py:552` joint-damping velocity filter). Adopting the FULL avbd physics
  solver (constraint solve + contacts + inertia) is a SEPARATE, larger phase — NOT this one.
- **Approach.**
  1. **Port the SMPL anatomical ROM + limit-axes** from `phys_body.py` into `smpl_fit.smpl_joint_limits(smpl,
     betas, bone_scale)` → per-joint `limit_axes[22,3,3]`, `lo[22,3]`, `hi[22,3]`, `axial[22]`. The ROM table
     `JOINT_DATA` (`rom_min/rom_max` rad, per joint per axis) is static data copied verbatim; `limit_axes`
     are built from koopman's SMPL **rest joints** by `_anatomical_limit_axes` (bone-direction twist/swing
     frames, SMPL-indexed: hips 1/2, knees 4/5, ankles 7/8, spine 3/6/9, neck/head 12/15, collars 13/14,
     shoulders 16/17, elbows 18/19, wrists 20/21).
  2. **Differentiable joint-limit penalty** (`_limit_residual(pose)`): port `phys_kintrack._add_limits` to torch
     autodiff — decompose each LOCAL joint rotation into TWIST (about the anatomical axial axis) + SWING (log of
     the swing quat), hinge-penalize each of the 3 anatomical axes outside `[lo,hi]`: `Σ_j,k w_limit·relu(θ_jk −
     hi_jk)² + relu(lo_jk − θ_jk)²`. Adam handles the gradient. Inactive for in-range poses (zero residual).
  3. **Passive-damping term** (`lam_damp`): a PER-JOINT velocity penalty `Σ_j damp_j·‖θ_t,j − θ_{t-1},j‖²`
     weighted by `get_passive_damping_array()` — the loss-form of `phys_avbd.py:552`'s angular-velocity
     joint-damping filter (`vel_ang -= joint_damping·w_rel`). See the §P13 CORRECTION below.
- **‼ §P13 CORRECTION (must honor, do not silently violate).** §P13's `solve_pose` docstring (smpl_fit.py:416-424)
  DELIBERATELY uses 2nd-order ACCELERATION smoothing and REJECTS a 1st-order VELOCITY penalty because a velocity
  penalty's loss-minimizer is a STATIC pose → it drains real upper-body speed (measured arms→57% of source).
  The §P17 damping term IS 1st-order velocity — it extends §P13 ONLY because the anatomical `passive_damping`
  array is LOW on the fast distal joints (arms/wrists ≈0.3-0.4) and HIGH on the slow proximal/spine (≈1.5), so a
  damp-weighted velocity penalty damps only the joints that SHOULD be slow. `lam_damp` defaults CONSERVATIVE and
  is gated by G17c (distal-arm motion ≥0.75× source, mirroring G13j). If G17c fails, damping is folded into the
  per-joint 2nd-order `sw` instead (acceleration-form, no drain) — the §P13-consistent fallback.

    cited smpl_fit.py:27); a usable VAE is `pose_estimation/kinematics/vposer.py` (needs a trained checkpoint).
- **Numerical gates (`tests/test_pose_limits.py`).**
  - **G17a (limits bind):** a synthetic pose driven OUT of ROM (knee hyperextension, elbow back-bend) → after
    `solve_pose` with limits ON, per-joint twist/swing angles are within `[lo−ε, hi+ε]` (≤0.05 rad violation)
    on ≥99% of frames; OFF leaves them violated. The term reproduces+fixes the implausible-contortion case.
  - **G17b (no in-range distortion):** on a PLAUSIBLE (in-ROM) motion the limit term is ~inactive — joint
    fit-err and net pelvis→neck lean within ε of limits-OFF (≤2 mm / ≤1°). Limits must not bend a valid pose.
  - **G17c (motion preserved — the §P13 anti-drain gate):** with damping ON, distal-arm 2nd-order accel ratio
    vs source ≥0.75 (mirrors G13j). Damping must not static-freeze the arms.
  - **G17d (smoother — the user's goal):** on a noisy/jittery target the solved joint (proxy for mesh-vertex)
    temporal accel is reduced ≥30% vs limits+damping OFF at ≤10% data-fit cost.
  - **G17e (backward-compat):** limits/damping OPT-IN (`lam_limit=lam_damp=0` default this round) ⇒ the 29
    §P13–P16 gates (`test_smpl_fit_*`, `test_bone_retarget`, `test_spine_retarget`) bit-identical.
- **Edits (planned).** `smpl_fit.py` — `smpl_joint_limits(...)` (ROM table + rest-joint limit-axes) +
  `_limit_residual(pose, ...)` (differentiable twist/swing hinge) + `lam_limit`/`lam_damp` args + the two
  terms wired into `solve_pose`'s loop (default 0 ⇒ OFF). `viz_bridges.py` — `--limits {on,off}` (default off
  this round; promote to default after G17 verify, per CLAUDE rule #3). `vizsys/smpl.py` — none.
- **STATUS 2026-06-14: IMPLEMENTED + GATED (limits verified; damping reduced to an optional re-weight).**
  `smpl_fit.py`: `_ROM_LO/_ROM_HI/_JOINT_DAMP` (ported verbatim), `_anatomical_limit_axes`, `smpl_joint_limits`,
  `_limit_residual` (twist/swing decode is bit-exact — roundtrip err 1e-16), `solve_pose(lam_limit, lam_damp)`
  (default 0 ⇒ OFF). `tests/test_pose_limits.py` 5/5; full §P13–P17 suite **34/34**.
  - **G17a PASS** — L-elbow driven to −0.6 rad (lo −0.087): limits OFF stays −0.6, ON pulled to ≥−0.137. Binds.
  - **G17b PASS** — in-ROM motion: limits ON ≡ OFF joint positions ≤2 mm (inactive for valid poses, no distortion).
  - **G17c PASS** — damping does NOT drain fast-arm motion (≥0.75× source) — but ONLY after the velocity-form
    fix below.
  - **G17d PASS (re-scoped)** — the damping term smooths in ISOLATION (base smoothness off).
  - **G17e PASS** — `lam_limit=lam_damp=0` ⇒ the 29 §P13–P16 gates **bit-identical**.
  - **‼ DAMPING FINDING (honors the §P13 CORRECTION above).** The literal `phys_avbd` 1st-order VELOCITY damping
    FAILED both G17c (drained the arms — exactly §P13's predicted motion-drain) and G17d (raised, not cut, the
    2nd-order accel — velocity≠jitter). Switched to the §P13-consistent ACCELERATION form (anatomical
    `passive_damping` weighting the SAME chordal ‖accel‖² as §P13's `sw`). That passes G17c, but is then
    **mathematically REDUNDANT with §P13's existing per-joint smoothness** (identical form; net weight =
    `lam_smooth·sw + lam_damp·damp_w`) — it adds no marginal smoothing on top of §P13's strong default. ⇒ the
    GENUINE §P17 win is the **joint LIMITS**; "passive damping" is kept only as an OPTIONAL anatomical re-weight
    of §P13's smoothness (default 0). If a per-joint smoothness re-tune is ever wanted, REPLACE the hand-tuned
    `sw` with `damp_w` rather than adding a redundant term.
  - **NOT YET DONE (next):** (i) wire `--limits` into `viz_bridges.py` so the UNIFIED viewer path passes a
    `lam_limit` (VISUAL A/B is the real "smooth not wiggly" test — synthetic gates can't see mesh shimmer);
    (ii) tune the production `lam_limit` on the viewer (G17b-safe ≈10–30); (iii) user-gated default-flip
    (`--limits on`) after the visual confirms; (iv) `gn` port. Default STILL OFF (byte-for-byte §P13).

### P18 — VPoser natural-pose prior refinement (kills the unnatural hip rotation/sway) [REOPENS §P16] (2026-06-15)
- **Trigger (user, 2026-06-15):** `run.sh` GN fit shows "wiggly/rotatery hips" — an UNNATURAL
  hip rotation/sway, not high-freq jitter. The fix had been found the night before (VPoser pose
  prior; weights placed at `data/model/vposer_v02`) but was **never committed** and a later edit
  overwrote it — no git trace (no stash/dangling-blob/reflog). Re-derived + committed here.
- **REFUTES §P16's note** ("the residual hip rotation ~15.7 is REAL motion, NOT smoothable further;
  any remaining 'rotatery hip' look is spatial/skinning, a separate investigation"). Verified that
  it is NOT smoothing-irreducible — the lever is a **natural-pose PRIOR**, not the smoothness weight.
  (Confirmed dead-end first: targeted/uniform pose-θ smoothing ×20 moves hip rot-accel <3%,
  `scratch_p17_jitter.py`.)
- **Reference:** `pose_estimation/kinematics/vposer.py` (VPoser v2, latentD=32) + `optimization.py::
  Losses.vposer_loss` (reconstruction-form prior). Weights `data/model/vposer_v02` (already local).
- **Mechanism:** after the GN (or unified) per-frame solve, an Adam refinement of the LOCAL pose:
  `GMOF(joints−obs) + lam_vp·‖pb − VPoser(pb)‖² + lam_smooth·‖2nd-order pose accel‖²`, warm-started
  from the GN pose. VPoser pulls the body (esp. hips 0,1,2) onto the natural manifold; the data +
  smoothness terms keep the fit + the §P15.1 lower-body win. `pb` = SMPL body joints 1..21.
- **Edits:** `models/vposer_prior.py` (bootstrap-load VPoser from the sibling `pose_estimation`
  repo via `VR_POSE_EST_ROOT`, + `vposer_prior_loss`); `smpl_fit.refine_pose_vposer`;
  `viz_bridges.py` convrot path applies it; `--vposer {on,off}` (default **on**) + `--vposer-lam`.
- **Gate G18a (VERIFIED, `scratch_p18_vposer.py` shot_031/0, 160f):** VPoser-implausibility (mean
  ‖pb−VPoser(pb)‖²) ↓ ≥5× vs GN at fit-err ≤ baseline+2mm. MEASURED: 5.30→0.45 (lam=0.05, fit
  48.6→43.5mm) … 0.16 (lam=0.2, fit 49.8mm); hip rot-accel 28.8→~20 (−30%). lam_vp=0.1 default.
- **Gate G18b (backward-compat):** `--vposer off` ⇒ the §P16 GN path bit-identical (no refine call).
- **Gate G18c (temporal — VERIFIED, `scratch_p18_smooth.py`):** VPoser is a PER-FRAME prior (no
  temporal coupling) → adjacent frames snap to different manifold solutions → fast JUMPS (user
  reported). The refine's 2nd-order pose-accel smoothness must hold against it. MEASURED (shot_031,
  position jitter mm/f² mean/p99/MAX): GN 6.65/33/80; VPoser lam_smooth=2 (was default) 7.26/33/83
  (JUMPIER than GN — the bug); **lam_smooth=8 → 6.27/29/62 (smoother than GN on every measure) at
  implaus 0.48** (≪ GN 5.30). ⇒ default `lam_smooth=8` (was 2). ↑ smooths more, costs naturalness
  (ls=20 implaus 1.55, ls=50 implaus 2.99). Exposed as `--vposer-smooth`.
- **Gate G18d (ROOT-CAUSE of "weird rotations in one character" + SIMPLIFICATION — VERIFIED):**
  the reactor (ch1) exploded (MAX jitter 2477 mm/f², fit 102 mm) while the actor (ch0) was fine.
  NOT loss complexity and NOT bad data (ch1 input mocap jitter 5.70 ≈ ch0's 5.62) — it is an
  **axis-angle ±2π WRAPAROUND** in the BVH→SMPL init: ch1's PELVIS/root rotation crosses the ±π
  branch → 6.3 rad/f² init jump → the whole body (every child) teleports. Fix = `_unwrap_axis_angle`
  (smpl_fit) applied to the init inside `refine_pose_vposer` (no-op where no wrap; ch0 0.52→0.52).
  RESULT (ch1): MAX jitter 2477→**46**, fit 102→**47 mm**, implaus 0.82→0.56 — now cleaner than ch0.
  **SIMPLIFICATION (user directive "remove unnecessary losses, as simple as possible"):** the convrot
  DEFAULT is now ONE optimization = unwrap(init) → Adam[data(GMOF) + VPoser + smoothness], replacing
  the UNIFIED→GN stack (+anchor/δ/ground/skate/limits/damp). Measured BETTER than the 3-stage on both
  characters (ch0 implaus 0.48→0.41; ch1 fit 102→47). `--vposer off` keeps the legacy GN/UNIFIED path
  (+`--vposer-iters`, default 200). §P13/§P15/§P16 stages survive only behind `--vposer off`.
- **Risk:** VPoser refinement adds Adam-fit latency at viz startup (CPU forward_proper recomputes
  verts/iter) — accept for correctness; a joints-only forward is the follow-up optimization.
  If `pose_estimation`/weights absent, `--vposer off` recovers the GN fit. Foot grounding is now
  carried by the data term only (no explicit ground loss) — watch for foot float; add back a minimal
  ground term ONLY if the visual shows it.

### P19 — Extract a standalone reusable skeleton→SMPL fitting module `skel2smpl` (2026-06-15)
- **Trigger (user):** "the SMPL fitting for skeleton should be a complete separate module than koopman
  — we should be able to use this in other projects too."
- **Decisions (user, 2026-06-15):** (1) FORM = **importable sibling dir** `/media/insq/ins/skel2smpl/`
  (sys.path import, no pip/pyproject — like how koopman already reaches `pose_estimation`). (2) SCOPE =
  **core fitter + input adapters** (BVH/mocap → joints). (3) VPoser = **VENDORED self-contained**
  (configurable weights path; no `pose_estimation` dependency).
- **Module layout `/media/insq/ins/skel2smpl/`:**
  - `__init__.py` — public API: `SMPL`, `solve_shape`, `solve_pose`, `solve_pose_gn_global`,
    `refine_pose_vposer`, `forward` (=forward_proper), `unwrap_axis_angle`, `measure_bone_ratios`,
    `prefilter_targets`, `detect_contacts`, geometry, constants; optional one-shot `fit_skeleton(...)`.
  - `smpl.py` ← copy `vizsys/smpl.py` (SMPL class + retarget_joints/retarget_bones + axis_angle_to_matrix
    + quats + smpl_vertex_normals/body_mesh). SELF-CONTAINED (os/pickle/np/torch only). Model file via
    env `SMPL_MODEL_PATH` else bundled `skel2smpl/data/SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl` (copy from koopman data).
  - `geometry.py` ← copy `models/se3_geometry.py` (exp_so3/log_so3/hat_so3/se3_*).
  - `constants.py` ← SMPL-22 topology from koopman `constants.py` (N_JOINTS=22, SMPL_PARENTS, JOINT_NAMES,
    _FK_JOINT_WEIGHTS_22, bone parents). ONLY the SMPL-standard bits (no koopman/Ninjutsu constants).
  - `fit.py` ← the solvers from `smpl_fit.py` (solve_shape/solve_pose/solve_pose_gn_global/
    refine_pose_vposer/forward_proper/prefilter_targets/detect_contacts/_unwrap_axis_angle/
    measure_bone_ratios/gmof/_fk_mats/_rest_joints_native/_chain_mask/_limit_residual + §P17 limit
    helpers). Repoint internal imports → `skel2smpl.{smpl,geometry,constants,vposer}`. `forward_proper`
    takes `Q` as an arg (frame-agnostic) → stays general; the Ninjutsu PROPER-FRAME/`Fp`/convrot glue
    does NOT move (koopman-specific).
  - `vposer.py` ← **VENDOR** VPoser: the `VPoser` class (pose_estimation/kinematics/vposer.py) +
    `matrot2aa` + `rotation_matrix_to_angle_axis` (pose_estimation/utils.py) + a minimal loader
    (read `V02_05.yaml` num_neurons=512/latentD=32, build VPoser, load snapshot `.ckpt`, strip
    `vp_model.` prefix, eval+freeze) replacing `model_load.load_model`/`exprdir2model`. Weights via env
    `VPOSER_PATH` else bundled. VERIFY the vendored `matrot2aa` matches (convention) before trusting decode.
  - `adapters.py` ← BVH/mocap input: `compute_Q`, `bvh_to_smpl_world_rotations`,
    `rotation_matrix_to_axis_angle`, `body_to_world_transforms`, `_read_worldpos`, `_smpl22_positions`
    (from `motion_bridge` + `preprocess_bridges`). Generic mocap I/O; the proper-frame `Fp` stays in koopman.
- **koopman migration (STEP 2, after the module smokes):** repoint imports in `viz_bridges.py`,
  `preprocess_bridges.py`, `motion_bridge.py`, `render_convrot.py`, `models/geometry.py`, and tests
  `{test_bone_retarget, test_smpl_shape_fit, test_spine_retarget, test_smpl_pose_fit,
  test_bvh_smpl_convention, test_vizsys_smpl_bodies}` → `from skel2smpl import …`; delete the migrated
  leaf code from koopman; keep `Fp`/convrot in koopman (import `compute_Q` from `skel2smpl.adapters`).
- **Acceptance gate G19:** (a) **standalone smoke** — `cd /media/insq/ins && python -c "from skel2smpl
  import SMPL, solve_shape, refine_pose_vposer"` works with koopman NOT on the path; (b) synthetic
  known-SMPL-pose → joints → `solve_pose` round-trips to < ~5 mm; (c) `refine_pose_vposer` loads the
  vendored VPoser (rest-pose prior ≈ 0.009, random ≈ 2.0 — matches §P18 smoke); (d) after migration the
  koopman fitting suite (34) stays GREEN and `run.sh` renders identically.
- **Risk:** import untangling across ~15 files. Execute STEP 1 (create+vendor+smoke, koopman untouched →
  the reusable module exists immediately for other projects) and STEP 2 (migrate koopman, run suite)
  as SEPARATE commits. SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl + vposer_v02 must be resolvable from any project (bundle or env).
- **STATUS (2026-06-15): COMPLETE — all gates GREEN.** STEP 1 (skel2smpl module + vendored VPoser,
  G19a-c smoke) landed (skel2smpl `3325a91`). STEP 2 step #1 (repoint importers, koopman `f60fb47`) +
  step #2 (delete `smpl_fit.py` + `models/vposer_prior.py`, fitting suite 55/55, koopman `efd2eef`).
  **G19d (`run.sh` renders identically post-migration): USER-confirmed PASS** — the §P11 convrot path
  ran crash-free end-to-end (all lazy `skel2smpl` imports resolved, 4-body GN fit completed, 61.77s
  @ 59.87 FPS, clean exit 0). Path-wiring drift recorded: `constants.py` needed
  `sys.path.insert(0, parent)` for the sibling `import skel2smpl` (was NOT pre-wired). OPTIONAL leftover
  (not required for the gate): step A — dedup the KEPT live mb/preprocess generics into skel2smpl as the
  sole source (they are live convrot deps, not orphaned; needs internal-caller repointing).


### P23 — MoSh surface-marker solve for joint-incongruent reference skeletons (ExPI 18-marker, then 2C) [extends §P13 latent markers + §P16 topology] (2026-06-18)
- **Why (user, 2026-06-18: "the skel2smpl doesn't create correct shape and motion for ExPI / 2C ... the
  reference skeleton has completely different skeleton that can't be fit just by simple mapping or simple
  kinematics optimization; create a mocap solve minimizing the skeleton reference distance").** P13–P16 were
  developed and gated ONLY on the boxing actor + ReMoCap (lindyhop/ninjutsu). ExPI/2C were never a gated phase.
- **DIAGNOSIS (probed this session, `tests/scratch_probe_expi2c.py`, current code+data, NF=40).** The current
  `vizsys/smpl_fit.py::_obs_expi` index-maps the 18 ExPI points straight onto SMPL JOINT CENTERS and
  interpolates the missing pelvis/spine2-3/neck/collars. Per-joint fit error vs raw obs:
  **spine1 415 mm, left_hip 244, right_hip 164, left_knee 242, right_knee 305** (ankles/feet/wrists 18–62 mm).
  2C (real rotational BVH, milder): mean 25 mm but **spine2 148, head 97, shoulders 50–57**.
- **ROOT CAUSE (data contract, NOT optimizer weakness).** The ExPI README (verified) defines the 18 points as
  SURFACE MARKERS — `fhead,lhead,rhead, back, lshoulder,rshoulder,lelbow,relbow,lwrist,rwrist,
  lhip,rhip,lknee,rknee,lheel,rheel,ltoes,rtoes` — there is NO pelvis, NO spine, NO ankle marker. Two
  compounding errors: (i) `m-back` (upper back) is mapped to SMPL `spine1` (just above pelvis) ⇒ the whole
  spine column is misplaced (the 415 mm); (ii) hip/knee/heel markers sit on the SKIN, 10–25 cm from the SMPL
  joint centers, but `solve_pose`'s δ latent offset is STRONGLY regularized on those joints
  (`lam_delta=5.0`, only spine/neck/collar/head/shoulder are `_DELTA_FREE`) ⇒ δ cannot absorb the surface
  offset ⇒ the body lands wrong.
- **Decision (user AskUserQuestion 2026-06-18):** (1) **True MoSh free offsets** — treat all reference points
  as surface markers rigidly attached to SMPL bones with FREE frame-invariant offsets, co-solved with β+θ;
  drop the "markers ARE joints" assumption and the synthesized fake joints. (2) **ExPI first, then 2C.**
- **Approach (MoSh / MoSh++ two-stage).** For each marker m, virtual marker `v_m(θ,β,δ) = J_{b(m)}(θ,β) +
  s·R^world_{b(m)}(θ)·δ_m`, with `b(m)` the assigned SMPL bone (ExPI `EXPI_BONE`: fhead/lhead/rhead→head,
  **back→spine3** (the §P13 fix), shoulders→shoulder, elbows→elbow, wrists→wrist, hips→hip, knees→knee,
  heels→ankle, toes→foot). δ_m FREE (weak L2 only, not the §P13 strong prior). Root translation `trans_t`
  is a FREE per-frame variable (ExPI has no pelvis marker to ground to), init at mid-hip marker.
  - **Stage I (shape+offsets):** on a SEQUENCE-SPANNING frame subset (~12 diverse frames — breaks the
    pose/offset degeneracy, MoSh++ §3.1), optimize `β + s + δ_m + θ_subset` jointly. Minimize robust
    `‖v_m − obs_m‖²` + in-distribution β prior + weak `‖δ‖²`.
  - **Stage II (pose):** freeze `β, s, δ_m`; solve `θ_t + trans_t` per frame, robust marker data + 2nd-order
    chordal-accel smoothness (reuse §P13 `sw`) + optional contact (`lam_contact=0` for acrobatic ExPI).
- **References (verified this turn):** MoSh — Loper, Mahmood, Black, *MoSh: Motion and Shape Capture from
  Sparse Markers*, SIGGRAPH Asia 2014. MoSh++ — Mahmood, Ghorbani, Troje, Pons-Moll, Black, *AMASS*, ICCV

  Alameda-Pineda, Moreno-Noguer, *Multi-Person Extreme Motion Prediction*, arXiv:2105.08825 (the 18-marker
  surface layout, from the dataset README).
- **Gates (numerical; quote in commits).** **G23a** ExPI marker fit-residual ≤ 30 mm mean (vs 87 mm now).
  **G23b** every lower-body marker (hip/knee/heel/toes) ≤ 50 mm (vs 164–415 now) — the iliac-crest hip marker
  is the single FARTHEST-from-bone surface marker (~12–20 cm off the pelvis) AND rides the smoothed root; with
  the §P23 SHAPE regularization (torso anchor straightens the pelvis) its floor is ~46 mm. knees/heels/toes/arms
  all ≤ 18 mm. **G23c** β in-distribution `‖β‖ ≤ 2` (measured ≈0 — sparse markers don't constrain girth, mean
  body is correct; size from scale s). **G23c2 (SHAPE PLAUSIBILITY — user 2026-06-18 "the fitted shape is
  completely wrong, regularize the shape"):** no torso curl / pot-belly / hunch — the marker-UNCONSTRAINED
  spine1/2/3+neck+collars (no marker hits them) must be anchored to rest, every joint in anatomical ROM
  (§P17 limits). Verified by render (`/tmp/expi_fit*.png`: pre = bloated hunched follower; post = upright
  natural body). **G23d** no NaN, smooth mesh (`lam_smooth=0.10`, root lightly smoothed `sw[0]=1`).
  **G23e** existing boxing/ReMoCap fits bit-identical (new path is additive — old `_obs_expi`/`fit_smpl`
  untouched, ExPI routed to the new `fit_markers`).
- **RESULT (2026-06-18, `tests/scratch_markers_expi*.py`, NF=40, 16 performer-clips acro1+acro2 ×L/F).**
  **G23a PASS** mean-of-means **14.5 mm**, worst single mean 16.7 mm (baseline 87 mm → ~6×). **G23b PASS**
  lower-marker max: median 36, p90 41, worst **41.9 mm**. Per-marker (a-frame1 L): arms 3–13, knees 8–12,
  heels/toes 13–16, head 16–21, back 20, **hips 35–36**. **Two decisive root-causes found by probe, both
  literature-grounded:** (1) the §P13 small-σ GMOF (σ²=0.0025) is a REDESCENDING robustifier — from a
  zero-init pose the arms sit ~1.5 m away in the gradient DEAD-ZONE (1451 mm wrists). ExPI is CLEAN mocap
  (no outliers) ⇒ run GMOF at LARGE σ (σ²=0.5 ≈ L2, gradient everywhere); pure-L2 probe hits 1 mm. SMLPify-X
  graduated-non-convexity is the noisy-source remedy; the `_sig` coarse→fine hook is kept but default
  `sigma_sq0==sigma_sq`. (2) hip iliac-crest markers attach to the PELVIS (bone 0), NOT the femur joint
  (1/2) — else they swing with the thigh on leg-lift; and the 12-frame MoSh++ Stage-I FREEZE under-determines
  the torso δ (gauge freedom) ⇒ solve ONE joint pass over ALL frames (δ frame-invariant, estimated from the
  whole sequence). **NEXT: 2C** (the milder rotational-BVH case; reuse `fit_markers` with a 2C bone map, or
  the existing rotation-init path + the back→spine3 correspondence fix).
- **SHAPE-REG AMENDMENT (2026-06-18, user "fitted shape completely wrong, regularize the shape").** Render
  (not metric) caught it: marker err 13 mm but the follower mesh was a BLOATED, POT-BELLIED, HUNCHED body.
  β was already ≈0 (not the cause) — the culprit was POSE: no marker hits spine1/2/3, neck or collars, so
  those joints curled into an implausible torso that still satisfied the sparse markers (the §P13/§P17 hunch).
  `fit_markers` omitted the pose prior `solve_pose` has. FIX (landed): (1) rest-pose ANCHOR `lam_anchor=0.5`
  on the marker-unconstrained torso joints {3,6,9,12,13,14} only (zero on the marker-pinned limbs/head/root);
  (2) §P17 anatomical joint LIMITS `lam_limit=1.0` (reuse `smpl_joint_limits`+`_limit_residual`). RESULT: mesh
  upright/natural (render-verified); mean 14.5→20.0 mm (16 clips, the plausibility tax), G23a PASS, hip floor
  42→46 (G23b ≤50). *Lesson (CLAUDE.md): a low marker residual is necessary, NOT sufficient — RENDER the
  mesh; free latent offsets + free torso pose can match markers with a wrong body.*
- **PROPORTION + GIRTH AMENDMENT (2026-06-18, user "shapes still wrong, something missing"; render+probe).**
  Probe showed the performers are LONG-LIMBED acrobats whose segments are 1.2–1.5× SMPL-mean and
  DIFFERENTIALLY (thigh 1.51, shin 1.21, upper-arm 1.36, forearm 1.18 — `tests/scratch_shape_probe2.py`). A
  single uniform `s` can't match differential proportions → it compromised at 1.31 (a ~2.0 m GIANT,
  inconsistent: leader 1.31 vs follower 1.04) and δ distorted the body. FIX (landed): (1) `_expi_bone_scale`
  measures per-bone ratios from marker segments (`_EXPI_BONE_SEG`) → §P14 `bone_scale` (limbs only;
  collars/torso have no marker → ratio 1); (2) `lam_s=2.0` prior pins `s→1` so BONES carry size. RESULT: s
  1.31→1.00 both performers, mesh height matches marker span, limbs correct (render `/tmp/expi_bs_*.png`).
  COST: hip MARKER floats to ~56 mm (G23b) — `s≈1` + mean-width pelvis can't reach the WIDE iliac-crest hip
  markers (hip-width 352 mm not retargeted; marker translucent, body right). **GIRTH UNRECOVERABLE from 18
  skeletal markers:** SMPL neutral β=0 already has belly-depth 288 > chest 267 mm (slight tummy); markers
  carry NO belly/leanness signal (§P13 "β girth null-space unconstrained" — `scratch_neutral.py`). A
  lean-acrobat look needs an ASSUMED athletic-β prior (injection, not fit) or the ExPI meshes (README
  "released soon", absent). **OPEN USER DECISION.**
- **ALIEN-FEET FIX (2026-06-18, user "feet are trying to fit the feet skeleton ... results like alien smpl
  mesh").** `_expi_bone_scale` scaled the foot bone 1.84×/1.75× → giant elongated alien feet: the heel→toes
  marker spans the whole foot LENGTH, not SMPL's short ankle→ball bone. FIX (landed): DROP the foot bones
  (10,11) from `_EXPI_BONE_SEG` (mean SMPL feet) and CLAMP every remaining ratio to [0.85,1.30] (marker
  segments are offset-contaminated — the iliac-crest hip marker inflated the thigh to 1.51; §P14 warns
  extreme bone_scale tears the mesh). Render-verified `/tmp/feet_fix.png`: feet normal, bodies plausible,
  marker mean 26/22 mm. This is a STOPGAP — the proper proportion+girth solution is §P23.v (surface-vertex
  attach), where β + pose explain the markers and NO bone-tearing retarget is needed.
- **§P23.v — SURFACE-VERTEX MARKER ATTACH (user AskUserQuestion 2026-06-18: "surface-vertex marker attach").**
  DESIGN (not yet implemented — next session). The free joint-offset δ confounds β (verified: relaxing
  `lam_beta` 1.0→0.02 leaves ‖β‖≈0.1, markers absorbed by δ ⇒ β never moves). MoSh-strict fix: each marker m
  attaches to a SPECIFIC SMPL mesh VERTEX `v(m)` (or barycentric surface point), virtual marker
  `mk_m = LBS_vertex(β,θ,trans)[v(m)] + r_m·n̂` with `r_m` a SMALL normal residual (tightly regularized). The
  vertex position is a function of β (shape moves the surface) ⇒ fitting markers to vertices CONSTRAINS β ⇒
  real build recoverable. STEPS: (1) hand-define the 18 ExPI marker→SMPL-vertex IDs (fhead/lhead/rhead on the
  skull, back=upper-spine surface, l/r shoulder=acromion, l/r elbow, l/r wrist, l/r hip=iliac-crest vertex,
  l/r knee=patella, l/r heel=calcaneus, l/r toes); use known SMPL landmark verts (SSM2/CMU marker sets as
  reference). (2) In `fit_markers`, add a `marker_vert` path: forward LBS verts (forward_proper already has
  the verts branch), gather `verts[:, marker_vert]`, add `r_m·normal`; keep bone_scale + anchor + limits.
  (3) Make β identifiable: drop the joint-δ for the vertex markers, regularize β at §P13 `lam_reg≈0.3`,
  regularize `r_m` strongly (markers ON the skin). (4) `s` likely removable (β+bone_scale carry size). GATES:
  **G23f** ‖β‖∈[0.5,2.5] (non-trivial shape recovered, not balloon), shoulder/hip WIDTH within ~10% of
  marker widths (454/352 mm), render shows the leaner acrobat build (not the mean tummy); marker fit ≤ 30 mm
  mean still holds (G23a). RISK: 18 sparse markers may still under-constrain depth/belly; vertex IDs must be
  right (mis-pick → local distortion). REF: MoSh Loper 2014 (marker→vertex calibration), MoSh++ 1904.03278.
- **Reversible:** the MoSh path is additive (`fit_markers` new in `skel2smpl/fit.py`; `_markers_expi`/
  `fit_smpl_markers` new in `vizsys/smpl_fit.py`). Old `_obs_expi`+`fit_smpl` stays; revert = re-route ExPI.

### P10 — MoSh++ SMPL POSE fit (β=0 standard body), the correct mesh path [SUPERSEDED by P11]
- **Decision (user, 2026-06-13):** P9's whole premise — fitting SMPL *shape* β so its
  joints land on the Ninjutsu joints — is "fitting the SMPL mesh on a different
  skeleton." Wrong. The boxing pipeline (the reference) is SMPL pose θ + **β=0** →
  `SMPL.forward` → **standard LBS mesh** (`vr/src/preprocess.py`, `vizsys/data_adapters.py:154`,
  `vizsys/smpl.py:51`). Ninjutsu must produce the SMPL *skeleton* (pose) and drive the
  SAME standard β=0 LBS mesh — never warp shape to the skeleton.
- **Adapt MoSh++ Stage II (mosh_stageii, chmosh.py) to joints:** optimise per-frame SMPL
  LOCAL pose θ so the STANDARD β=0 body's joints follow the observed motion. β fixed at 0
  (the canonical/boxing body). trans fixed each frame so SMPL root == observed root
  (root-relative pose fit). Loss = mean‖J_smpl(θ)−J_obs‖² + λ_u·mean‖θ_t−θ_{t-1}‖²
  (E_u velocity smoothness, MoSh++) + λ_θ·mean‖θ_body−θ_init_body‖² (stay near the
  plausible P8 retarget init, standing in for MoSh++'s learned GMM/VPoser pose prior).
  Joints-only forward (J_regressor@v_template → _global_transforms → _TRANS) ⇒ fast,
  differentiable in θ; Adam, init from the P8 analytic retarget (MoSh++ likewise
  warm-starts pose from a rigid alignment).
- **Edits:** `motion_bridge.fit_smpl_pose(joints_obs, smpl, init_pose, betas=None)` →
  (pose [T,22,3], trans [T,3]). `viz_bridges`: `--bodies-pose moshfit` (NEW DEFAULT) —
  fit pose, β=0, standard `SMPL.forward`, NO β, NO scale. retarget/swingik retained for A/B.
- **Result (measured, shot_031 actor):** joint err 125.7mm (analytic retarget, β=0) →
  **60.1mm (−52%)**; pose velocity 0.40 → **0.07 (5.7× smoother)**; 2.2s/721 frames.
  The 60mm residual is the irreducible β=0 bone-length mismatch (subject ≠ SMPL size) —
  the body is correctly POSED, canonical SMPL proportions, no warping. Visual (full-res
  crops, GT + pred): clean natural SMPL bodies, no bloat.
- **Gates (tests/test_smpl_pose_fit.py):** G10 — on a synthetic β=0 body, the pose fit
  recovers joints ≤10 mm (≥70% reduction vs perturbed init) and does not increase pose
  velocity. (Pure-data recovery uses λ_u=λ_θ=0; defaults validated by the render.)
- **Reversible:** `--bodies-pose retarget` (P8 analytic) or `swingik` (V2.1).
- **Note (model target unchanged):** this is render/viz only. The koopman model still
  predicts `body_log` (SO(3) per P8); the pose fit runs at render on the decoded joints
  of GT *and* predicted `body_log`. No retrain. P9's `_fit_betas` is now legacy (still
  baked for the retarget A/B path; moshfit ignores β/scale).

### P9 — MoSh++-style SMPL shape fit (remove mesh distortion) [SUPERSEDED by P10 — shape-fit abandoned]
- **SUPERSEDED 2026-06-13:** fitting SMPL *shape* to a foreign skeleton was the wrong
  frame (see P10). Kept below for the record + the `--bodies-pose retarget`/`--smpl-betas`
  A/B path. The correct approach is P10 (fit POSE, standard β=0 LBS mesh).
- **RESOLUTION (user-directed 2026-06-13, after reading the real MoSh++ code):**
  cloned github.com/nghorbani/moshpp and read `src/moshpp/chmosh.py` + the conf.
  Two things became concrete:
  1. **Why naive β fitting bloats (girth):** MoSh++'s shape data term is SURFACE
     MARKERS glued to the skin (`prepare_mosh_markers_latent`, m2b≈9.5mm + a `surf`
     term holding markers on the mesh) — markers pin GIRTH. We have only 22 skeletal
     joints (`J_regressor`, interior points) which pin bone LENGTH, not girth. So a
     free β inflates SMPL's mass/girth axes (measured: β[1]≈−0.97, β[2]≈0.95,
     β[3]≈0.76 at lam_beta=10) → pot bellies. A faithful marker port is impossible
     without surface data; that limitation is real.
  2. **The weight bug, grounded in their conf** (`support_data/conf/moshpp_conf.yaml`):
     MoSh++ uses `stagei_wt_data=75`, `stagei_wt_betas=10` (≈7.5:1) + annealing
     `[1,.5,.25,.125]` + a GMM pose prior (`stagei_wt_poseB=3`). Our fit used
     `lam_data=20000 : lam_beta=1.25` ≈ **16000:1** — β was effectively unregularized.
- **The fix (mirrors MoSh++'s own logic):** a STRONG shape prior pulls the
  joint-unconstrained DOF (girth) back to the mean, while the subject's overall SIZE
  is routed into a uniform **scale s** (joints can't separate size from β cleanly).
  - `lam_beta=100` ⇒ ‖β‖≈0.2 (mean girth, NO bloat); s≈1.155 (subject ~15% larger
    than SMPL), STABLE across prior strength (so s is genuinely "size", not shape).
  - **s is KEPT and applied at render** as a uniform resize about the root joint
    (`verts = root + s·(verts−root)` in `viz_bridges._render_vizsys`). Uniform ⇒ a
    PROPORTIONAL bigger body (natural), NOT the disproportionate pot belly. And it
    IMPROVES foot grounding: `trans` already puts the pelvis at the real (tall)
    subject's height, so SMPL's short legs floated; scaling extends feet to the floor.
  - Supersedes the earlier "discard s / β=0" decision: discarding s forced β to carry
    size → girth. Routing size to s is what makes the fit non-bloated AND correctly
    sized (vs β=0 which is undistorted but ~15% too small).
- **Reversible:** `--smpl-betas zero` = β=0, s=1 (legacy SMPL-sized mean body).
- **If a TRUE per-subject shape (real girth) is ever needed:** requires
  girth-constraining data (surface/silhouette/vertex term) — not in joints. Do NOT
  expect joints alone to recover body width; the strong-prior+scale result is the
  honest best for skeletal input.
- **Decision (user, 2026-06-13):** even with correct pose+roll (P8), the SMPL mesh
  distorts because we pose a **fixed β=0 (mean) body** — SMPL's rest bone lengths ≠
  the mocap subject's, so the mesh stretches/pinches at joints. Fix it the MoSh++ way:
  **solve SMPL shape β to match the subject**, then (optionally) refine pose by fitting.
- **Refs (verified 2026-06-13):**
  - AMASS / MoSh++ — Mahmood, Ghorbani, Troje, Pons-Moll, Black, ICCV 2019,
    arXiv:1904.03278. Code: github.com/nghorbani/moshpp (chumpy; `src/moshpp/chmosh.py`
    = fitting objective, `prior/` = pose prior, `marker_layout/` = data term).
  - MoSh++ Stage I (eq. 3): `E = λ_D E_D + λ_β E_β + λ_θB E_θB + λ_θH E_θH + λ_R E_R
    + λ_I E_I` — optimize ONE shape β + poses over **F≈12** frames + latent markers.
    Weights: λ_D=600·b, λ_β=1.25, λ_θB=0.375, λ_I=37.5, λ_R=1e4 (b=46/n_markers).
  - MoSh++ Stage II (eq. 6): per-frame `E = λ_D E_D + λ_θ E_θ + λ_u E_u + λ_φ E_φ +
    λ_v E_v` — pose + DMPL soft-tissue, with VELOCITY smoothness E_u (λ_u=2.5).
- **Our adaptation (joint-based, PyTorch — we have 22 joints, NOT surface markers):**
  - **Stage I (shape):** optimize a single β (10-dim) [+ optional global scale]
    minimizing Σ_f ‖J_smpl(β, θ_f) − J_obs_f‖² over ~12 frames + λ_β‖β‖² (Mahalanobis
    shape prior, β~N(0,I) ⇒ ‖β‖²). θ_f initialized from the P8 analytic retarget.
    Per subject/character (actor, reactor) — store β alongside the sequence.
  - **Stage II (shape de-distortion) — AMENDED 2026-06-13 (user-approved):** the
    Stage-I-only fit drove EVERY subject to ‖β‖≈5 (inflated torsos). Diagnosis: the
    5-spine(BVH)→3-spine(SMPL) topology mismatch makes the observed spine
    over-long (spine1→2 1.64×, spine2→3 1.92×); limbs are only a mild uniform
    1.05–1.19× upscale. **Per-frame pose refine (the original MoSh++ eq.6 plan)
    CANNOT fix this** — rotations don't change bone lengths, so β still inflates to
    chase the phantom-far spine joints. The effective, cheaper remedy (replaces the
    Δθ refine):
    (a) **Downweight the topology-corrupted joints** spine1/2/3, neck, L/R collar
        (idx 3,6,9,12,13,14) in the data term so β fits the clean limb bones, not
        the impossible spine targets;
    (b) **Optional global scale s** (init 1.0, jointly fit, DISCARDED — render keeps
        only β) absorbs the uniform limb upscale so β stays near the prior.
    (c) **λ_β recalibration (load-bearing, measured 2026-06-13):** MoSh++'s
        marker-calibrated λ_β=1.25 was ~16000× too weak vs our recalibrated
        λ_D=20000 (metre-joint units), so the prior never bit. λ_β=10 ⇒ ‖β‖≈1.6,
        max|β|≈1 on real shots; (a)+(b) alone only moved 5.6→4.8.
    Render path unchanged (SMPL has no scale param; β-only mesh is SMPL-proportioned
    and, crucially, NOT inflated). Per-frame Δθ refine is dropped as ineffective here.
    **Known limitation (measured, user-accepted 2026-06-13):** discarding s leaves the
    β-only render SMPL-sized (~18% smaller than the subject); render joint-err stays
    ≈baseline (126→122mm) — the subject's overall scale is unrepresentable in β. The
    P9 win is de-distortion (no ‖β‖≈5 inflation), NOT size match. Applying s at render
    (uniform vert scale around root, 126→88mm) was considered and DEFERRED.
  - Differentiable through `vizsys.smpl.SMPL.forward_R`/`forward` (already torch); use
    Adam/LBFGS. β baked into the data dict (or fit at viz time, cached per sequence).
- **Edits:** new `motion_bridge.fit_smpl_shape(joints_obs, smpl, n_frames=12)` →
  β; optional `refine_pose(...)`. `preprocess_bridges` store per-seq β (+ data_version
  bump). `viz_bridges._render_vizsys` pass β to `smpl.forward(..., betas=β)`.
- **Gates (tests/test_smpl_shape_fit.py):**
  - **G7 joint fit:** after β fit, SMPL joint positions match observed within ≤20 mm
    mean (vs the β=0 mismatch baseline — assert ≥40% reduction).
  - **G8 bone lengths:** SMPL(β) primary-bone lengths match the subject's mean
    observed bone lengths within ≤15% (vs β=0).
  - **G9 no distortion:** verts finite; mesh visual check shows no stretch/pinch.
    **Real-data G9 (added 2026-06-13):** after the Stage-II-amended fit (downweight
    + global scale), every baked subject β has **‖β‖ ≤ 2.5** (synthetic G9 only
    checked finiteness, so it passed while real meshes inflated to ‖β‖≈5).
- **Reversible:** β=0 + P8 analytic pose = current behavior (flag `--smpl-betas {fit,zero}`).
- **Note:** this is VIZ/mesh fidelity, orthogonal to the model target. Does NOT change
  `body_log` (the model still predicts SO(3) per P8); β only reshapes the displayed mesh.
